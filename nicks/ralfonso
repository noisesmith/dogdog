patchwork: yeah, but a little more mature. I don't like the ruby dep, but it's ncie
nice

with #3, the app cannot distinguish between throttling and a simple csrf error

neildf: so guava Iterables was creating DataObjects for all posts when I did that limit(skip())
I changed it to subList. which is less sexy but does the right thing
neildf: skip/limit was causing the entire list to be DataObject'd
I wish campfire was just built on IRC

I need help naming an object
I have a page with several pieces of content. those pieces of content each have comments. rather than doing content.comments, I have a container that gets all of the comments for the entire page
I need a name for this container
it's not an object in the oop sense.
well I can't use the word page because it's already been reserved, and this might not be comments for just a page
it's for a maybe arbitrary list of "commentables"
that crossed my mind. not joking
ooh public
