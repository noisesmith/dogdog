So, somehow I forgot the sudo password on that damn server I have had for 80 years
I do love the shallow tree of a new nick
Yeah, trying out weechat
it rules!
All I want
irc in a console
Too bad I can't install it on that old server
Oh well, maybe it is time to put it out to pasture anyway
Rackspace hates me, they have had to migrate it three times from old platforms to new ones as they reimplement everything over and over again
It could be so much more effective if it could just focus on the task at hand

Ah funny. The mind, like the rest of our body, is not always under our direct control
Actually, the more you look at it the less it seems we really do have control over
Such a narrow band called "we"
Even the mind, the supposed purview of our will, runs on its own sometimes
Oh? interesting
We can only hope
This seems like a classic application of the lemon->lemon-juice theorem
