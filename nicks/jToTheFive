ahoy
neildf, i'd block you there too
that wins for the name
and it loses for ruby
trollop. you know like "i'll have one trollop of ice cream please."
bound to be one called the worst
c'mon man, it's just their last name
same with horsedrowner. guys name happens to be Keith Horsedrowner
believe that's a middle name
like phil tits michelson
teague did that
ugh
heyo
i thought it might be the order in which my app.html was loading the js. but it's that same as what's in caribou-admin
i haven't customized that though so it should be getting it from caribou admin
but this loads? http://weareinstrument.com:81/_admin/js/libs/jquery.timePicker.min.js
aah
i see
so that has to change in fields.js right?
i'm not overriding fields.js
i don't think
lemme look before making wild claims
I AM OVERRIDDING IT!!???!??!?!??!!
so should i just replace timePicker with timepicker and call it good?
yeah. checking the diff now
i must've done it for a reason
-      var id = this.get("id") || this.get("value.id") || null;
-      $( this.selector() ).val( id );
+      var current = $( this.selector() ).val();
+      if (!current) {
+        var id = this.get("id") || this.get("value.id") || null;
+        $( this.selector() ).val( id );
+      }
apart from timePicker > timepicker, that's the diff
i don't think i need to shadow
quile? i think this was grabbed from teague and i'm assuming you made that change then?
haha
yep. doing that now
in case you were all on the edge of your seats, removing the fields.js from weareinstrument fixed the js error and the other bug that was causing by that js error. rejoice.
