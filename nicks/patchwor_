Hey justin_smith: we are about to install a kafka cluster here. Any advice after you went through the whole process? I'm sure you could write a guide by now
Are you using a zookeeper cluster and a kafka cluster yet?
So what, three zookeeper machines and three kafka machines?
Ah, interesting
Ahh interesting
I do love using zookeeper though
but I see how that would work

Ha, right

Hmm I thought we were doing some kind of compare, or at least checking the result of the set or something. It has been too long though
Okay, good to know!
Yeah man, would love to read that blog post about setting up the kafka/zookeeper server
