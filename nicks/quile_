i think ecosystem is way better than framework
framework has too many implications
justin_smith: did that guy figure out his fs problem in the end?
unless something changed really recently and an old version of fs got sucked into caribou, it's not our fault
i use lighttable with new caribou apps, and since I fixed that fs issue, it's been great
another possibility is that lighttable has revved and something broke
"lunch balls catastrophe" sounds pretty painful
justin_smith: the routes are all built before the first request comes through, surely?
ah, not sure.  the routes are all assembled on startup
but you're prob right
hmm, that doesn't seem right... it should be instantaneous
sounds like something else is slowing shit down in there.
damn, it's like an elf party in here.
during the day, none of you guys are around, but as soon as the lights go out, you're all here.
um, I'm usually in there too
totally
