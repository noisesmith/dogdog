Of course, it needs a huge amount of data to start making any reasonable statements
Let's see if this works a little better
Is your face a capital letter?
I think you may have to convince us that you are actually sentient
It is better to have a face than to stand alone in the world
But a face has no real existence outside the rest of the head
It does seem to work better when you unite the tokens
Aha!  So not all tokens that end a statement in parsing end the same statement when generating
it will respond to you in the manner you speak
In the end, it is tracking everything we say
so if we are talking to each other, it will not be that weird
but you can certainly seed it with enough weirdness to be weird
it is only parroting back what each person says to it
he reflects our own minds back at us, so we can't help but love him
he is already emulating us pretty well
It has captured your essence precisely justin_smith!
I restored our discussion from previously as well
justin_smith:  Give it a shot, the snowpeople were not showing up in my emacs, but I think the chars are still there
I never ate lunch!
There we go
Alright awesome, the snowmen are intact!
I do
do you not see snowmen?
I don't see them in my emacs for some reason, but I do see them in the channel
Alright we have a friendly channel bot
who progressively emulates the channel inhabitants
My machine at the moment
I may put it on a server somewhere
https://github.com/prismofeverything/gort
Most of the complexity comes from persisting each nick's history in a file
Alright, now to eat some lunch (this took longer than I expected)
Tricky
Ha!
It won't actually /msg because it is performing the operation separately
but I see what you are trying to do there
I think you have created the ultimate snowman machine
Ha!
Now that is a true statement
Dude, snowman mayhem
Happy Tau Day!
: )
??????
Surely he will attain sentience soon under such conditions
You can call render-string on it, check out the tests in antlers/antler
It takes a string and a map
ralfonso: !!!!!
welcome back to the earthly plane yo!
Yeah gravity's a drag, but the food is tasty
ralfonso:  Also:   http://euroclojure.com/2013/
I want to submit a presentation for that one
submissions begin July 15th
Well yeah
(he responds to capital d's in case you guys were wondering)
All this DC talk is setting him off
There we go
Yeah, I wonder if instrument will spring for us to go to Berlin (!)
But if we were presenting it would provide a strong case
: )
Ah yeah!  I wonder what these people require in terms of a presentation proposal
Actually, looking at this:  http://euroclojure.com/2013/call-for-presentations/  we should have it covered
ralfonso:  Is it basically the same idea as pallet?
I haven't actually messed with puppet
That feedback loop may spiral out of control man, you would be hearing your own responses to yourself hearing the responses of the responses you are hearing...
Madness
Anyone going out to lunch today?
quile:  until you speak enough german that is probably all it will be able to say!
Ah yes, zalgo coming soon
possibly… capital Z?
??????????
I could have sworn you could add an attachment
is that a postmark limitation or a limitation of the clojure postmark library?
Do it, we should issue some pull requests if we are actually extending the functionality in significantly useful ways
Well, good to know that pdf's are always safe
Just attach some exe files renamed as ".pdf" !
Always true
????
quile man this bot is nasty
That is quite a selection of noun adjectives quile
!!!
What have we created?
Who doesn't?
zipper is a troubling presence in the noun list
He would be booted from #clojure in like 2 secondsx
I can send him into #caribou
Oh man, blop is not even in there any more
Oh yeah, he can join whatever channel we send him to
I am, I am
throat also, is a disturbing contribution
Speaking of bots:  http://i.imgur.com/dx7sVXj.jpg
Ha!  agreed
good story though
http://i.imgur.com/7BlZkcR.jpg
Yeah let's get some lunch
Ha!  That looks amazing
I like the ET homage at the end there
All superheroes should be required to be solved before they could perform any effective action
Hey mking!  how goes?
Have you held them up to a giant magnet?
I hear that snaps them into resonating capacity
CERN has a couple extra I think
As you can see, #instrument is still infested with bots
(but only as of Friday)
describes many people I see on a day to day basis
Once you start programming yourself, there is no stopping the juggernaut of recursion
Eventual result:  http://i.imgur.com/Vzp9JLK.jpg
I can never bring myself to revert
It would feel like scooping out your own brain with a spoon
Yeah man you seeded that three word poem with some pretty gruesome inhabitants
It filters out the most common triggers
Otherwise it would only say "D"
When did I ever say blop?
justin_smith:  currently just an exclusive or.  Inclusive may get out of control?
It could be combinatorial, ie combine every directive into a single phrase
Z3D would return a three word poem composed of your own statements rendered in zalgo
Yeah my IRC client is dragging as well.  I'm not sure the coders who wrote these things were optimizing for Zalgo
It must be some serious algorithmagic to apply all of those tibetan characters over each other recursively
erc!  I stopped using that because I was watching my erc buffer instead of coding
Yeah I guess on reflection it did not solve the problem, as now I am just screwing around with bots in whatever client I am using
I keep all my planets on a dedicated planet shelf
but fungus can be a problem
They are all out of the tectonic stuff
I should seed it with its own code
clojure eval sandbox?
You can export specific tables
Also, a sql dump is just a text file so you can remove the lines you don't want
Right.  You could export what you need as EDN?
So are they model changes or content changes?
justin_smith:  We need a generalized method for this
If I had three weeks to code it...
(which maybe I do!)
quile:  Sam Aaron?
That guy is overtone powerhouse
Ah!  yeah other overtone powerhouse
They have a pretty tight-knit community
justin_smith:  I was just thinking that
would probably not be too hard to write, the question is how do you represent the diffs in a way that is programmatically usable?
There you go
(forming an algorithm in my head)
But are you updating a map afterwards?  Aren't you trying to navigate it and perform operations for each diff?
That sounds right, when you say update-in I am just imagining a giant list of parallel paths into a map
which could be unwieldly, and possibly redundant
I am imagining a more concise representation exists
But again, if it works that is the first requirement!
Ah, there I was thinking of a general arbitrary-depth algorithm
Yeah but if you are just tracking model differences it is model —> field
two levels
Really you could just transform that into a model update, or directly into a migration
Alright, my ride is leaving
mking, good to see you!
#instrument channel revival
Good morning.  Apparently the world is still maD
I had a lot of donor in berlin
which has a lot of turkish people
donor everywhere
it is tasty
justin_smith: Do you mean a vector of the differences between the results?
I is amazing how many times I type capital D's without noticing
Got it
quile:  You want to get some lunch?
justin_smith:  That looks like a rubik's cube
Also:  reality
Ah yes!
one moment
sql-lite error!
Luckily the exceptions don't compromise his state anymore
Yeah
I added that in after some exceptions destroyed his ability to respond
!!!
oh man
Ha!  apparently the regex does not include non-alphanumerics
"We", as in quile who invented all this
conjoined orthogonal polyhedron… that almost makes sense
quile:  Then we could not add new words like hypoencephalomatic
Are we already abusing the new found power you have given us quile?
three
Nice
!!
I love it, great addition
quile:  If you need to edit the db let me know
I don't know what git conflicts for a sqlite db would be like
First act:  removing balls
Here, I'll take care of that right now
For some reason I never get a long statement from zalgo
Maybe I am doing something wrong there
Hey AWM1:  what is this program your dad wrote?
What other kinds of stuff does he do?
quile: LOTS more code to make these handlers, but in the end it will be better
composeability and flexibility comes at a price (always)
quile:  Can you pass {:adjective … :noun … } into the three word poem generator?
cool
justin_smith:  That is terrible.  The world may never recover from your sheer audacity
I would like to see this in action
Nusto!  It was barfing on "filename too long" when compiling zalgo.clj
Do a pull on master quile, check out the code
do you know any poems?
do you know any poems in zalgo?
Dude, rhombus supernova melody….
Did you add it to the twp handler?
Did you install nrepl through package.el?
Apparently freenode is under a DDOS
Apparently they have been under more frequent and longer duration DDOS this year
Oh yeah.  ChessPlayer is a classic FUD spreading troll
It has a version number of 0.11.31-COMPOSIBLE
Oh man, as if juicy harpy slit was not a bad enough poem
3 word poems are endlessly fun
I thought we filtered out the 3's and the word adding?
Hey justin_smith:  Do you have headspace now to sort out all these caribou versions in the wild?
Well, s3 is a storage layer, like a db
frontend should farm out to core for any s3 stuff, if that makes sense...
So really, the s3 stuff could almost go in lichen
The question is:  should someone using lichen as a standalone be able to resize images from s3 back to s3?
justin_smith:  the endpoint (whether on disk or s3) things get resized to will have to be configured in core
3(A-B-C-D)t^2 + 2Bt + C
Do we have tests for all this?
We might just want to return the path to the new asset, whether it is on s3 or locally
Right, so maybe we just return a URL object, which works for s3 or on disk
Have you ever seen the same noun three times?
{{#= environment :production}}CONDITIONAL ON PRODUCTION{{/=environment :production}}
Do you have `=` as a helper?
Alright, how about the difference between these two:  https://www.refheap.com/16753
Delinearizing the program
Drone lady!
Everyone says get the DJI phantom instead (which is almost $700!)
Done with sudoku
Definitely feeling some murakutei today
I spent three years in a panda zoo in the human exhibit until funding went dry, then I was just released into the wild
Hey justin_smith:  Did you work out your lichen issues?
quile:  Do you have the latest webserver benchmarks?
Do not fear the future
As of 3 minutes ago
What do you mean?  Do we use alter-var-root?
Done!

Dude!  there is already an o'reilly book?
justin_smith:  Do we need to have the size of the file before uploading to s3?
Which is really only a problem for s3
I can even get the size after the stream is written to disk, but once again, doesn't work for s3
I guess we could just read the whole thing in to find the size, then post it to s3
So:  File, URL, byte array, string all work fine for s3 or disk
Sure, if the upload to s3 returns the size
Dude I can't even get a basic cljs file to compile
justin_smith:  Do you have any notes on your beanstalk deployment?
justin_smith:  Do you have any notes on deploying to beanstalk?
ralfonso:  Actually, I will send out my current thoughts on how to define routes and pages using EDN so you can check it out
Does pedestal have nested routes?
I thought of a better name for the 3d node game
1x1:  bit — 1x2:  foot — 1x3:  island — 2x1:  monolith — 2x2:  byte — 3x1: tower
I met with Max last night and we were trying to imagine 3d vectors of complex numbers
but three planes all orthogonal… 6d visualization
This is a great book all about trying to imagine a fourth spatial dimension: http://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Relativity-Fourth-Dimension-Rudolf/dp/0486234002
Question about the distinction between routes and pages:  Does a method (like GET or POST) go with a route, or with the page?
Dude, nrepl?
Right, that is full IDE right there
justin_smith:  Did you write down any of that conversation we had about the blog post you were going to make?
quile:  Dude, what did you do to Daisy?
ralfonso:  Do you have lein-ring installed?
justin_smith:  Did we ever release that latest version of lichen?
justin_smith:  Do you have a version of frontend somewhere using the latest lichen?
New version of lein-caribou:  2.3.0
Well, I guess that is covered in the -D=environment=production etc
justin_smith:  Do the prod deploy
Didn't mean to give you shit
quile:  Does it work?
So in your project.clj just update the versions of the three libs
Do they both have the same context-path?
Does it have :path-info in there?
Dude!  I have seen that video
You are using s3 right?
Does it have to do a request for every resize?
We just keep a map of which urls have been resized locally so we don't have to check s3
Dude!  That is an achievement
DTC is akin to an old squashed starburst candy
http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes/
DON'T DO IT JSMITH
Don't let them compromise implementation just for perceived "admin simplicity"
Dude, I need to live there
Dude, you should sign up
quile:  Doesn't that make you anxious?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCzvc3Cl6xE
justin_smith:  Do you have a passport?
http://travel.state.gov/passport/hurry/hurry_831.html
Looks like 2-3 weeks for the expedited one
3+++++
Do we really need that stuff?
We can put that in the README's I think
Definitely something will be called "Mysterium"
{{inc 5 | + 33}} —> 39
justin_smith:  Did you have a lichen fix?
WWCWJD
WWJDDD?
Did they fix the unicode table name issue?
justin_smith:  What is our latest situation for hosting assets on s3?
Ah!  Did you see we got resizing on s3 working? : )
Ah, s3 is high latency?
Do you have 0.12.8 for everything?
justin_smith:  What is in all these packages you are using?  0.11.29-P2… 0.11.32-COMPOSIBLE?
Do you have the same ruby version as everyone else?
Doesn't grunt just compile things?  Have you compared the compiled output and see if it is different?
: D
Dude, it should not be too bad
Didn't you have some thoughts about that?
Do you have head space to help with logging, with the eventual goal of releasing the router as a separate lib?
Dude!
Did you guys sign up for that?
Das ist stimmt
Du kennst mehr Deutsch, als ich
Does that mess with your situation?
0.12.13 gives you enum ordering and where conditions as well
Yeah, just pushed latest 0.12.13
You should have 0.12.13 core now
Alright, how about hawaiian TODAY?
Do we have a comprehensive readme for lichen?
Docs also: never complete
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/603283/what-is-the-best-java-image-processing-library-approach
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874593/loading-large-images-as-thumbnails-without-memory-issues-in-java
Are you running through the s3 resize?
Each is getting hung up on s3 latency, all that is hanging out in memory
I can't get resident above 300, which is reasonable
TIME #inst "2013-09-18T22:03:13.869-00:00" MEMORY USAGE: 81.0625
Have you collected them all?  Do they ever recur?
Dude, those are obvious strikeouts
Did hawaiian destroy you?
Processing is pretty vast at this point, I think it even does 3d
http://24.media.tumblr.com/66107f7ecf8d6cb13ac324a216f91111/tumblr_mlweptIulO1sp7oalo1_400.gif
Alright quile:  Do you need this ordering order ordering?
justin_smith:  Do you have it outside the wrap-caribou call?
Dude, I love your new language
Do they render the same template or different templates?
von jetzt weiter, so viel Deutsch wie möglich
H U N D H U N D H U N D
Datomic is rad
Du verlierst dein Verstand
justin_smith:  Dawn is awesome.  I'm sure she would help you if you asked
justin_smith:  Don't let that stop you
You have to have the three db's that correspond to the three test-* configs
Diving in now
Ich habe ein gut chatten mit meinem Deutsch Freund gehabt
Er bestimmt meinen schlechten Deutsch
Dude, hund does not have an umlaut
Do we use it anywhere?
Does it not work?
This is a pretty good article on the permgen problem justin_smith found: http://cdivilly.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/permgen-memory-leak/
Dude, just bind the tree you create in routes.clj to some global var
CAN YOU HANDLE IT
But explicit is better than implicit, and I feel the implicit AND is kind of a hack at this point
quile:  Did you talk to J5?
Now that I have written all these docs too it felt pretty straightforward to get the README going
Did you guys work out the admin issue?
Database does not exist
Basically the upload-to-s3 function requires size now… Does the s3 upload require a size argument?
Done!
does it make sense to link it from the README?
Deps are the silliest
justin_smith:  INDEED
Do an update
How can we have a 3wp about a commandline?  It is a single noun, just with a compound representation
Doesn't settle entirely well it seems
Do they have to interact at all?
Dude, it does not need to be that complicated
Do you need it now?
Dude, if you want to work on the admin-something before that hits check out creating roles+permissions
Huh?  Do you have everything pushed up?
quile:  Do you want the new template?  I will push it up, just a second
quile:  What is the format for three word poems?
I think he parsed ==D as its own word
Does it??
Have any of you seen beyond the black rainbow?   http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1534085/
The first review is pretty good: http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1534085/reviews?ref_=tt_ov_rt
Did you make a bot of some kind?
Okay, now for the moment of truth
but he will persist everything else
Yeah what is all this?
Why don't we just take some tequila shots?
That was an ancient victory for justin_smith
quile:  What's up?
quile:  I get it now!
Apparently I have used a curly brace before
ZD
I am not clicking that link
Beethoven wins
Beethoven has more views in history overall
I am also listening to music but can hear both, so the synergy is amazing
Right!  If ever an email mentions his name, he will respond with a paragraph
We should give him something with long text, like Atlas Shrugged
Yeah send it out to devs.  I don't think this is anything that anyone even thinks about, so getting it on the radar would be the first step
Check this out: https://github.com/bitemyapp/revise/
Oh yeah?
What did he have to say about it?
It looks cool, is it really a clojure db with no sql behind it?
Aha
so it is a frontend for a nosql
Oh, weird!
Okay, less interested now!
ha
Ha!  Well then...
That sounds right
I think it gets inserted when you call % lein ring server
I don't know why that tries to insert middleware for you
Seems like it is overstepping its bounds
Wow, all of this is amazing
That was easy
Alright just ran through the demo again
This thing is good to go
I'm going to record this thing, then let's kick it out the door
Ha
That is amazing
Our api exports csv
_api/model.csv
It quotes them
Are you on an old version?
I just tried it and it worked
Ah
Oh I misread
Our api quotes the csv, I'm not sure about your situation
I am down for anything
thinking of sushi
quile:  You in for lunch today?
Ha!
justin_smith:  You down for sushi?
I just added rainbow parens to everything, suddenly my code looks amazing
My code is now literally a rainbow
starting with purple going down the spectrum
Yep, painstaking rainbow construction
It is all worth it
Datomic is my favorite 3d library
Yes
Well, once we get the php -> clojure tool working...
Cool idea
Would that be useful?  Sounds good to me!
justin_smith:  Good question, no clue!
some people still fear irc?
Sometimes
though in general yeah
Looks like it yeah
Yeah, we say s3 way too much to dogdog
Wow, a trapezoid vasectomy
Yeah, not a pleasant procedure
Well that is nicer
Radical!
PAREDIT FOR LIFE
quile:  Yes I worked on it yesterday… just getting started on the frontend!
I was planning on working on it today as well
Want to have a powwow about the frontend actually?
Yeah let's have a session later today
!
I should be further along by this afternoon… maybe 3:00?
Spectacular
quile:  Radical
Yeah I can get it in the next release
I am planning to release 0.13.0, gathering all the random changes
Well, neil is basically an adjective
#clojure is basically unreadable now that all I ever see is "bitemyapp" everywhere D
Worst nick ever
makes me not even want to read the channel
Maybe I should ignore the guy and infer his statements from the replies
Officially more #clojure users than #django users
#ruby:  arguing about how to make the language faster
#django:  how to build a url out of a reference to an image on disk
Yeah, this is a good conversation so far (on #perl)
#clojure has the least dicks of any channel I've been on so far
Empirical anecdotal evidence
Ha!  Right, yeah well I was in just-forge-ahead mode
Sometimes you have to play the hand you are dealt
Not as bad as that one attempt!
quile:  Did you watch the whole thing?
quile:  The ending is the best part
The siphons work great
Seriously awesome feature
Cool
It is really a caribou demo, and not really an introduction to caribou per se
That is my main issue with it when I take a step back
We need like a 3 minute "What is caribou?" video with cool motion graphics etc
Right!
Here's a schmetterling question:  Break on every exception, or make the user say what exceptions to break on?
Provide a breakpoint/break on exception API?
???
Ah, in the middle of getting some things working, I'll let you guys know when it would be productive to pair up soon
I can say this much:  it is radical
The mysterium is upon us
Of course
55555 D
quile:  lunch soon?
justin_smith:  Maybe I will use datomic finally?
Also justin_smith:  I like how you are hanging out on IRC for your vacation day!
quile:  Alright meeting should be wrapping up soon
quile:  Let's go!
Who is obsesseD with s3
Someone should let her know
justin_smith:  Not yet!
so close
still under basic-auth
Really??
Right
Basically I just need to make a new release and we are good to go
I think we will release on Tuesday
I love numerical holidays
I want a graph theoretic holiday
That is composed of distinctive graph relationships
Ha!  Good point
In a format that actually makes sense
rather than the arbitrary ordering we use
Whoa… wtf!!
Well, they probably have backups on their own machines?
Automation can destroy things just as much as (possibly more than?) human error apparently
So someone must have the most recent repos for all of these, right?
On their machine
Since someone had to code it in the first place!
Wow, so the process made this inevitable really
Gnarly
Ah, that is good to know
quile justin_smith: You guys down for lunch today?
You guys have an idea of where to go?
Dare I propose:  Hawaii?
Volcanos?
How do you feel about now?
As in:  right now!
In a way, it is the only time
No other times exist really
There exists a now where we are happily eating hawaiian food
quile:  What the hell is "cool time"?
alright, turning of hotspot seemed to fix it!
That is fortunate
I have access to the locals from the let
(+ a b) —> 1
Radical, this thing is good to go
So many gotchas with the JVM
Yes thank you justin_smith
Aha, thanks quile!  For some reason I couldn't find anything on using ObjectReference
I guess I needed to know to look in the larger context of java reflection
quile:  Right!  Even the class is an Object that refers to the class rather than an actual Class class… !
It is a form of madness
Gangst is gooD
patternosis is also good
Hyperpatternplex
So what was Phong talking about the centering of that list in the Caribou docs?
It looks centered to me
Also:  Just got a 403 on http://use.typekit.net/c/639a07/freight-sans-pro !
quile:  You know what is up with typekit??  weird
Huh
Ah well
Caribou is released!  http://let-caribou.in/
Drafting a message to the Clojure mailing list right now
Radical : )
justin_smith:  We really need to update the README for lichen
justin_smith:  I updated the version, but it needs full usage
It still said antler/lichen!
justin_smith:  Right, that usage still works
justin_smith: Yes!
Apparently it is waiting for approval
Well, apparently my post must be approved by a human being
Who knows when that will be?
Gah!  Right on the verge, then denied...
Time to exercise some patience then...
PATIENCE IS ANNOYING
Ahem
Alright, post up!
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/KeyaMJERW0o
Now we wait
Ah, I was thinking about just taking over #caribou after all...
Yo justin_smith!
I have not seen
you mean on #clojure?
I just logged in
So wait, what would be an async call?
Also, I just saw you posted about the immutant thing
Is that still an issue?  I thought I fixed that, but is it still a dependency in order to run?
Have you tried the latest template?
Right, it's in the template, but you don't have to install it right?
Okay
What is wrap-request?
wrap-request-map?
Ah, that is some relic from long ago
I didn't even realize that was still inthere
We don't even use that, we can take it out
So the other one would be the config yeah?
Right, it is the pure functional way to do things
Wait though, the config is not changing per thread
it is the same in all threads
Or it should be
That is why we were talking about using avout, to synchronize the config across all threads (and instances)
How would that happen?
Well, the init function is always called… so yeah?
When JB used butterfly, we initialized it in the init method
Not that I know of
init is always called, other threads are spawned from there
So it is not actually an issue then?  I'm sorry I missed this conversation!
Well, I thought that is what we were doing with the whole config thing
I'll talk to him about it, but not right now
As I understand our current setup, there is only one config that is owned by the user, and the var just acts as a reference to that
it is not changing in different threads etc
unless there is something I am missing
Ah, but you can have several configs, and just call (with-caribou other-config …) with a different one and get a different app
So anything in the same (with-caribou) call uses the same config...
Right, just trying to understand that
What is the nature of this mess?
Okay
I see… hmm...
So this would only be an issue if you were using two configs at once?
Why would you ever use two configs at once… huh
I thought you would do that if you switched it out in the repl, for testing or something
Yeah
But I don't really see why you would do it in a single request… do you?
weird
I think the argument applies to that wrap-request situation, but I just took that out!
that is a good catch
Okay, too bad it was even in there
Ah I see also immutant is listed in the dependencies
interesting...
I just checked, it is a dependency
even if you don't use it, it is still listed in dependencies and it still downloads
I fixed the thing where it would error out on you in weird cases
but I guess it is still a dependency *sigh*
I wonder if there is a way to support it without having it be a dependency?
not sure about that
ring and immutant use the same handler
We will have to think about it
it is nice to support it
as long as it doesn't interfere with anything
So wait, is search indexing still a problem?
Yeah, but without doing that is it broken?
We should figure that out too.  It sucks to not have search if it is in tomcat
Yeah, because if it fails on tomcat deploy we need to fix it
Right, but tomcat can use the disk, just not a dir inside its deployed tree
So it would be fine, if we configure it right
Maybe we could write the index to s3 or something insane
or another cache somewhere in memory
Ah, interesting
Yeah, that could work
Right
Then lichen could just use that… maybe
Yeah man have a good one!
justin_smith:  We will have to avoid just spamming the channel about it
Like this guy who is asking right now
tempted to point him to caribou, but maybe I will restrain myself!
Right, I would much rather other people suggest it!
Hmm… people talking about formatting issues.  Must be something with the md->html converter
quile:  http://caribou.github.io/caribou/docs/models.html
existingconfiguration
Wait, how did it disappear?
Hmm… not on my machine
Ha!  what?
Who wrote it?
Wow, crazy!
Alright
Well, if he retracted it, won't he be upset about that?
quile:  All over the model page
It looks like if a line ends abruptly, rather than with a space, it will run together
quile:  fixing now
justin_smith: Agreed
justin_smith:  I don't see the repo
Maybe when he deleted it it deleted all forks?
Is that possible?
Really!
do you have a url?
I don't find it on clojars either
Alright, found it
I can pull the jar and extract the code??
Ha
He is also the guy behind all the reload stuff
He wrote tools.namespace
Forked
Did he give a reason?
Wow, crazy
Hilarious that I pushed it at some point in the past!
Not sure where that came from
Maybe ralfonso_ did it?
Ah no, it was me!
I did it on October 2nd apparently
it was a SNAPSHOT version and I wanted to deploy it
So I forked it and changed the version
quile:  fixed some formatting I found in model.html
Did you find any others?
Ha!  Someone already posted to /r/clojure:  http://www.reddit.com/r/Clojure/comments/1qi7mo/releasing_caribou_today_open_source_clojure_web/
Right, people really seem to like it!
Well… for now
Yeah it is
Cool to see!
And, the caribou repo has 12 stars!  and three forks!  hahaha
Even schmetterling has 5 stars… crazy
Ha!  probably
No one likes immutant?  Immutant is rad
*sigh*
Right
quile:  Good question!
Yeah, maybe I can fix the md->html lib, since it seems to be consistently any newlines inside a list
I am thinking about postponing clojure workshop today
in the middle of some stuff
I love the kebab concept
This is important informatino
That is cool
Weird functions
I think this might be covered by reducers, but I am not sure
I have never used them
Right, something like that
justin_smith:  What was going slow?
Right on!
I was just wondering what Kara was talking about, was something slow on teague?
Ah right!
Okay cool
Yeah as long as we have some kind of caching it should be fine
what is the url?
Seemed to load fast for me!
quile:  Spectacular
Can't wait to see the demo : )
Yeah, that is huge
justin_smith:  What do you mean?
I have no idea what that means
Ah… so that is what poop is
Such a multifaceted word, poop
Right
Or like jenkins scale poop
"Pull a jenkins" is now a significant phrase
Evaluating clojure expressions in a java context
by the way, totally works
Now displaying locals
I love this thing
Ha, little do they know the darkness that lies within
Give it awhile, they will be cursing us soon
quile:  You going to lunch today?
Want to go soon?
We could do indian : )
That is always quick
justin_smith:  You down for lunch?
justin_smith:  Ha!  that sounds good
quile:  Want to go soon?  : )
quile:  It is always cool time
This is why I am not cool
It is too annoying
Then I judge coolness as wankery
Then I am cool.  Metacool
Will some cool person come and judge my locals styling?  I think it may be too extreme
(can locals be TOO extreme?)
http://i.imgur.com/W49yd0z.gif
Sometimes I just gaze at my code lovingly without even understanding it
There you be D
quile:  Where did you go yo!+
You have been replaced
Ha!
I saw that live once
was ridiculous and amazing
quile:  Invoked a remote method from an ObjectReference
Got the List of Methods from the ReferenceType of the ObjectReference, found the one I want, passed in the ThreadReference and got a StringReference back
I feel like this is some kind of rite of passage
Now nothing will be too convolutedly abstract for me to deal with
Ha!  I was drunk when I wrote my response to taht
probably not a good policy
Still, I stand by it
Just had my teeth cleaned
Always a medieval experience
Love that tune
quile:  What the hell!
Your dad is amazing
*drunken rambling*
Speaking of lunch...
Anyone down for lunch today?
quile_:  Let's go!
Fine by me
Ha!  They (rightfully) jab at the ecosystem part : )
I still think it is better than framework
justin_smith:  Did you help him out?
quile_:  agreed
My favorite kind of obscenity
Teaching positive values
Wow, that is insane
Dude, looks beautiful!
Now THAT would be amazing
Oh right!
is it not default in production.clj?
I have to update that thing
we should not be reloading controllers or templates either
Yeah, we have to turn of template reloading… I think
let me check
Ah no, templates don't reload by default
You should make sure you don't have a {:template {:cache-strategy :never}}
Oh wait!  right, yeah you have to set that to {:template {:cache-strategy :always}}
To cache the templates
Just push to caribou-development
I'll get it in the template later, once we are ready to release
Yeah weird, I just tried on caribou-development and it loads the routes the first request and just serves them
Ah, are you turning off controller reloading?
{:controller {:reload false}}
Well, it only reloads if things have changed
even if :reload true
justin_smith:  I believe you, but it is not happening on the regular caribou-development site, so it must be something else you are doing
quile:  What happened to your underscore?
That seems wrong
it should set a cookie for each client, not request
caching issues?
caching is issues
justin_smith:  Anything like this?  http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13933703/varnish-3-0-2-problems-with-post-requests
Looks like varnish can fuck with posts
That may be wise
What is the deal?
??
How is that even possible?
What are the differences between production and staging?
Yeah, turns out it was the thing trying to make index files
Yeah, we should have an option
But really, you can support it on ec2
Right, that is a way to turn it off!
So does that mean they can have admin search on ec2?  Is there any other obstacle?
Embrace search into your heart justin_smith
How is that different from a let?
Hmm… so a single binding let macro
interesting
I did not know that!
quile:  I'm sure it would be, we have just never supported it!
We force indexing upon the user, whether they like it or not
I don't know why this comes up over and over… immutant is optional (though it is still a dependency)
You don't have to use it
Indexing, you do
But not anymore…
Well, somehow something always goes wrong on launch
It is some kind of universal law
Though it is always good to reflect on how problems could have been avoided
As in: How did it get this far without anyone realizing save didn't work on production?  Seems like it would have come up before now
Ah yes
That is always a good policy
There you go
ralfonso:  What does it do?
PageComments
: )
CommentProxy
CommentOmnibus
It is not bad
I love omnibus in general
of course I already added that
Speaking of!  quile can you hit up lunch today?
I'll drive
jinx!
ralfonso:  CommentZoo
with every type of comment a different species with a separate comment habitat
You could export them using caribou-core/src/caribou/io.clj
as edn
Then import them
No the id thing is a problem, id's are assigned automatically
What would they do?
justin_smith:  Ah yeah, that should definitely be on there
Well holy hell.  The more you know
It is only because of sadness that doesn't actually work
http://i.imgur.com/TbRAFaA.png?1
This is the coolest thing ever
That sounds mad
MADNESS
I fear for us all
The stacktrace of poocafe will live for all time
quile:  Can you help with this scrolling thing?  I am close (or maybe not)
Trying to figure out the right combo of properties : )
No worries
Thomas for some reason is MIA
I was talking to that guy
had a wacky java install
Yep!
Right
We could check it out
Do you have an idea of how you would use it to solve our problem?
Let's see what everyone else wants to do, maybe a simpler starting place will be best, but who knows?
Has no dot product
justin_smith:  It works great from a fresh schema
So you can export models and content
from one dgb
and import it into a different db
justin_smith:  I haven't yet tried it with a db that is already populated with other content
but in theory it should work
The trick is if you have associated things, you have to export both sides of the association to maintain references
But that will improve once I start using UUID's for everything
basically, everything will have to change (uuid instead of id for basically everything… I think)
(still puzzling on that one)
It would mean changing how every reference works in the system
which could be correct
but will be a huge amount of work
Still thinking about the best way to go about it
justin_smith:  Yeah man
This is all radical
justin_smith:  Definitely talk to Phong first
As in changes that are done and waiting for review before they can be released
(review by whom, that is unknown)
(or undefined)
That could be helpful
quile:  I got this working if you want check it out
quile:  Down for lunch?
Ha!  have good
That is amazing
Yeah it is pretty cool
He has canonized his approach to reloading
We can just fork it and everyone will use ours once he renames it or takes it down or whatever
He just has a severe philosophy on backward compatibility
Which is not necessarily wrong, but maybe wrong
The cycle has to end somewhere
justin_smith:  I am open to any recommendations
quile:  If you feel like taking a break you should come critique my animations (just getting started on history now… !)
quile:  THE VALKYRIE CALLS YOUR NAME
quile:  Two moments
It is awesome
and egregious
quile:  Alright man, check this out
quile:  Alright man I think schmetterling is ready to go
I'm going to pimp out the readme and announce the thing
Yeah what is that about?
quile: https://github.com/prismofeverything/schmetterling
Also, we are headed to Riyadh's if you want some schwarma
Cool!
quile:  Do you know how to use gimp?
Make a butterfly : )
with vector graphics
I am kind of getting it
Yeah, this thing is vast
good call
Uh-oh
LONG PAUSE
Why am I talking about s3 all the time dogdog?
I have to purge that from your memory banks
JUSTICE FOR DOGDOG
yes dogdog, we are using s3
Good morning #instrument!
quile:  How is your project coming along?
quile:  Soooooo… you are done then?  : D
quile:  Got it
justin_smith:  When you were trying to make us tracked by the NSA
That is always a danger
quile:  Lunch today?
quile:  Foodcarts?  Robo?  Bunk?
hawaii?
OTHER?
neildf:  Purdy and I are talking about building a library for managing state across networks
which would be the basis for a variety of things, including network games
quile:  Yes, specifically, CHARRED MESH
quile:  Let's go!
neildf:  Hawaiian food?
justin_smith:  the build, this place and weareinstrument all use it
I guess I wasn't referring to your deploys!
justin_smith:  Immutant is awesome
Do you have something against it?
http://immutant.org/
It does far more than that
The messaging API is especially interesting
quile:  What was the thing you reminded me I was going to do for the next Caribou release?
forgetting momentarily
Ah!  Right!
Agreed
On the list
Understood!
I have a pile of random things to do for the next release
Most of them are pretty minor
The hero we need
I love it
quile:  caribou meeting?
Is it too early for lunch?
justin_smith:  Radical!
let's build some audio browser animal
I'm not sure anymore
I think so
I changed it up recently
with all the config stuff
I can look in a minute if you don't find it
Awesome
Alright, just released a lein template for generating projects that use clojurescript to communicate with httpkit over websockets!
https://github.com/prismofeverything/cljs-ws
(since it took a minute to set up the first time)
justin_smith:  Alright let me take a look
All you need to do is run (caribou.model/invoke-models) for the model cache
Ah!  I see what you mean
Yeah init should clear the queries
That is an oversight
Well just include it with the rest of your avout pr
invoke-models should do it
Ah!  I see
So you just insert the avout ref into the request?
Or what?
That will be highly general, I like it
I'm curious how it will all work with the model/query stuff
(and pages!)
Though I think I see
The pages, models and queries are stored in separate atoms in the config var
Check out caribou/app/handler.clj
in caribou-frontend
You pass a reloading function into the initial call to generate the caribou handler
(usually in the core.clj of your project)
And that gets called
when the handler needs to be regenerated
No, reset is a function
that does the resetting
That is passed in by the user
Right
I am leaning towards indian
quile?
justin_smith:  You need to call caribou.app.handler/reset-handler
That is not enough
please read handler.clj
That would probably help!
quile:  Food today?
Heading out soon
Cool.  Meeting our friend Annie out there
quile:  How goes over there?
justin_smith:  I don't understand
the problem
How would you tell which keys changed?
And yes, all or nothing is probably better
capturing them where?
It is not clear of what you speak
Truly, varnish can destroy many things
!!!
Apparently so, because that was hilarious
Right, the next step I am plotting is adding references to things people are talking about
Whenever I stop doing ten million other things
That is where I need to compile the list of low frequency words, or even nouns
probably nouns would make it the most relevant
Just because I ran somewhere doesn't mean running in general is relevant
Ah!  I'm out tomorrow
Monday : )
justin_smith:  Just a minute
How was justin_smith not on the caribou team?
http://www.performant.com/
I would rather replace that whole phrase rather than just a singe word
It smacks of vacuous marketing jargon
which I guess it is
Can someone come up with something better?
Or am I just being a bastard here?
No dogdog, not even in zalgo
Better
Our tagline could be in zalgo
justin_smith:  Right, something better
not worse
How about "Migrate across the open web tundra, avoiding blood-sucking bit flies and bit wolves devouring your young"
How about "Grow antlers out of your eyes, destroy the enemy"
It is at least better
justin_smith:  This is true
ralfonso would often complain about this
"build alpine migratory websites with the something you want and some other thing blah blah orb"
"Dedicated awesomeness for your awesome engine of truth"
"Arboreal tachyschism for your hatchling web spawn"
justin_smith:  Use one arg that is a list instead
justin_smith:  Now THAT is a tagline
I mean, no joke
That could work
impale, mighty, and appropriate in one sentence
No idea
grep the src
Is it actually different?
Maybe I could have named it, but metaspace should be reserved for something way cooler than that
Wow… !
How does that happen?
justin_smith:  What kind of load is zookeeper designed for?
Do you have a good reference on this?  Curious about what the issue is
Just network latency?
Right, I see
So, what we need is messaging functionality
So the question is now: is avout the best tool for that?
I would rather receive a message than check values for changes
Let's try it.  I know we could make a middleware that checks the value, but it should work even if people are just using core (which wouldn't be a ring handler)
And without scattering value checks all over the code (and maybe missing some)
Interesting.  So we can have one atom with a map of keys->booleans
It would not always be a model update though
The watch would trigger, but we would need to see what message was passed out of a selection of messages
So each one is a channel of sorts
I like the channel idea, I am not sure about the increment.  It seems inelegant to store a number when all we need is a signal.  That and overflow.  But the idea as a whole is sound
As for the plugin model, I feel like we still need to talk about the design for that before we rush into implementing anything
I don't think we ever landed anywhere as to the best approach for that, as I recall?
Though I am stoked to hear about your idea for it
Cool!  So let's talk about it before you hurl into implementation : )
In other news, I am currently mediating an aggressive and foul-spirited denizen of the clojure community on the schmetterling repo : )
https://github.com/prismofeverything/schmetterling/issues/3
Right, it is a protocol
I just don't see how it fits with schmetterling (for the reasons provided)
I don't think the guy has even used it, or given it any thought as to how they would work together!
Not worried : )
I like how I have spent this whole morning responding to pull requests and github issues, and not coded a single thing
(yogthos issued a pull request for refactoring templating!)
It is cool, and not cool
It looks good
Yeah, he does
I will have to make some modifications
But as a whole it makes sense
He also left in a big-ass println : )
We have postulated about it for so long, and now it is here
justin_smith:  Right, but how would you control it?
Well, I see it is possible, but it would be completely bypassing the rest of the nrepl functionality
Which makes me feel like it is superfluous to nrepl
But they would still have to build a completely new UI for it
At that point, what they really want is an nrepl middleware for cdt
Which I believe exists
"I now have had my foggy crystal ball for quite a long time.  Its predictions are invariably gloomy and usually correct, but I am quite used to that and they won't keep me from giving you a few suggestions, even if it is merely an exercise in futility whose only effect is to make you feel guilty" — E. W. Dijkstra
http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~EWD/ewd10xx/EWD1036.PDF
Dijkstra has failed spectacularly in warning us away from anthropomorphizing programs and computational entities, despite his well-reasoned arguments against it
"The moral of the story is: deal with all the elements of the set by ignoring them and working with the set's definition."
Dijkstra:  My favorite historical curmudgeon
justin_smith:  Yep!  For a moment
what's up?
quile:  How much did you work over the break?
justin_smith:  Yeah!  I actually worked httpkit in there recently, the current caribou-development is currently using it if you > lein run
I would worry about exposing it directly to port 80 without nginx in front of it
Yeah
justin_smith:  nginx rejects a lot of requests that aren't coming in with the right host for instance
All that chatter would have to be handled by the app itself, with conditionals added etc
justin_smith:  I don't think so.  If so that is news to me
Have you used nginx much?
Which uses tomcat, and presumably something else in front of it
I mean on beanstalk
It doesn't need to be mandatory, but it provides a service that raw http servers do not
Apache also does this
http-kit behind nginx could be great though
Yeah we wouldn't really need that anymore
I think the main thing nginx (or apache, but we don't use that) provides us are domain routing, proxying requests to different ports on the backend
It is nice to have something routing requests to different ports, rather than hogging all of port 80
Right!
I haven't used varnish much, does it route requests to different ports based on host?
I'm curious about the comparison with nginx, it is basically the same
has its own config
nginx is blazing fast
Really??  Where are these benchmarks
?
Alright, I have to get out of here
See you tomorrow?
Hmm…….. interesting
So only http-kit so far, but not with fewer threads
Huh, looks good!
Might as well have a provide-hooks as well
I dig it
Yeah, the hooks can just be in a map that can be merged into the larger hooks map
of the same structure
Right
All in all seems right.
We will probably have to add some more methods to the protocol
I wonder where templates and js fit in, for instance
I have been thinking about the db adapters
They really wouldn't cover nosql things in their current state
Currently they just abstract over differences in sql
Right
Basically we take what is in db.clj and turn it into a protocol
Also, query.clj
The execute-query needs to be in a protocol, and not generate an explicit sql statement
Yeah, this will be something to tackle for sure
Yeah, that is the goal
Ha!  Yes, that is the way
So much to do
Well, making the protocol and implementing it are two different things
We can work on it together
Not yet though!  Let's get the plugin thing working with a blog/comment system
Then we can use it on let-caribou.in
THEN we can build the db adapter : )
Oh yeah, I'll add that to the list
Maybe we can implement the whole thing as a monad, somehow
Agreed
Whatever solves our state issue : )
Irony is always the best motivation
org.sonatype.aether.transfer.ArtifactNotFoundException: Could not find artifact org.clojure:algo.monads:jar:0.1.3-SNAPSHOT in clojars
algo.monad
It is at 0.1.4
just found it
https://github.com/clojure/algo.monads
Ah yeah!
I don't know if anyone else has time, but we can meet
I have been hanging out on #caribou ; )
Why is that helpful?
Ah
Well, if you use the mouse that is ; )
Right, okay
seems to take away precious codespace
I want five displays
one just flashing new cat photos every 20ms
I want to live in a glowing bubble that floats in space
Oh wait… I already do
Space is the bubble that floats in space
Oh man, some indian or hawaiian would be awesome today
quile?  You down?
I like how we go through this every time
Sounds cool, have you installed it?
Listening...
Oh man, which js svg lib:  snap.js, svg.js, raphael.js … ?? D
Yeah, thinking about snap, seems straightforward
All the apis look the same : P
justin_smith:  I like the quartet!  Some good tones in there
Some feedback:  I feel like sometimes when you stroke the bow it can sound uncertain
some time spent on getting long consistent tones would pay off I bet
Then you can modulate with control and intention
Ha!  Of course
Well then, that came across
Is there such a thing as intentional uncertainty??
I feel like that is a koan
"Embrace the intentional uncertainty"
Ha!  Yeah
Apology accepted : )
justin_smith:  What did you have in mind?
No that makes sense, I think
would have to see the code
A map of maps:  {:migration.key {:migrate (fn [] …) :rollback (fn [] …)} :next.migration {:migrate …} ...}
Or list of maps
for ordering
That sounds right
Though migrations exist before there are models
(in the pantheon of Caribou creation myth)
So there couldn't be a migration model, because migrations generate the models!
Yeah probably
paredit is the shit
I love it now
can't imagine how I ever lived without it
Ha!  Org-mode consumes all things
Not sure
It sounds like you are doing two things at once
Are you building plugins, or making the persistence adapter?
Choose one, we'll deal with the other one later
This is true
We have been talking about too many things today : )
Or not enough
justin_smith:  Once polaris is integrated yes
I want to do that as well
Somehow that didn't happen before release
As if by mysterious force
(I didn't get around to it)
I will do it, no branch
Yeah, suxors
Ha!  That task is never done, but that is the idea
Lunch dance?  Shall we engage the lunch parameter?
LUNCH
What is that?
Ahhh, I see
that is cool
Elisp the mighty
Right, it is the javascript of lisp
but you can make your editor do anything
quile:  Yeah, I am responding to him
Me too, seems like a good guy
I don't think caribou.io solves his problem
He probably needs to write a custom import migration
justin_smith:  What feature?
Ah right
I mean, it can be done, but yeah
quile:  That would help
I mean no import solution can cover every case, but the more data we import, the closer we can get to a general import solution
Like this guy:  images with XML associated
justin_smith:  Yes, I added that in the last couple months sometime
Yeah, you can just send in the path as a value to model/create for an image field
Actually you can send in a number of things, I made a multimethod for it
quile:  I think so!
Yeah, it made sense somehow, since we were switching on the type
I think they took the coffee metaphor too far there
Or not far enough with everything else, one or the other
That really should exist
Lunch anyone??
justin_smith:  Have a second for stupid blender question?
Wow, in my spare time I screwed with some board games and read about cells
I love you guys
Wow man, that is pretty awesome
If I could make one change it would be to have the plugins accept a map as their configuration options in boot.clj
That way you know what is being configured
random "true"'s in arg lists remind me of C : )
justin_smith:  Right, but we could make a convention where they all take a single arg which is a mpa
*map
Then it would be descriptive
and compossible
Like, I want to know what that nil is nil'ing
And what that 1 means
Looks really cool though
I think this is the future
Yeah, but it could be a convention
just makes things clearer
more clear
Right
Magic!  : )
The macro is cool, but it is not so bad to be explicit
For some reason I distrust all that stuff
Really awesome man, let's plugin everything
Right
welcome back
Congrats!  Making the internet a better place
Radical
quile:  How is that possible?
quile:  But we have merged in master… ?
So commits you have made in develop don't show up as contributions in master when we merge them???
Weird
quile:  Yeah, still weird since all of your commits are in master, but I guess you have never pushed directly to master… ?
That seems broken
Yeah, git hub should look at commits, not pushes to github
I'll take a look at the default branch thing
: (
Hello #instrument!
Yeeeahhh!!
Ouch
quile!  How are you man?
getting on top of this nike project?
Alright
Right!  wow.  Deadly frozen clouds
Hark!  I believe this gentleman speaks the truth!
It has been some time since I have partook of the great Robotic Taco
quile:  You down?
justin_smith:  That is mad
just finishing up some things on the weareinstrument site, probably 5 minutes
check out legacy emmanuel
Yeah man, get that checked out
I thought we were on cigna??
I have no idea how this stuff works
Got it
Currently uploading 8 gigabytes of image data to s3
justin_smith:  This should be your slogan
Revealing holes in your unicode support since epoch
quile:  !!!
Is there something we need to do to generate the js again?
Maybe a grunt task or something?
No, this is the upgraded one!
quile;  I just upgraded it today
What is the error?
???
That makes no sense
Does it work locally?
Pfffffffff
Dude, that is a bad plugin
quile:  Sure
No worries, let me know
Wacky
Well, he seems cool
In that he is using Caribou successfully at least ; )
Everyone has their flaws
quile:  That opera error is happening locally as well
So something changed : P
In the admin
jquery timepicker error
GooD morning
quile:  $.browser has been removed in jquery 1.9
That is the issue
Can we just use 1.8, or are there features we need in 1.9?
Looks like we are using 1.10
Or maybe just upgrade that timepicker plugin
Yeah, doing it now!
jquery removes a feature, thousands of plugins break
ha
Latest timepicker errors out with: Uncaught TypeError: Object [object Object] has no method 'timePicker' D
: (
Alright, got it
That was annoying
Hmm… did I offend that guy?
Uh-oh
He is booting
Apparently it takes awhile to parse all of our files now
justin_smith:  The idea of a metric is that they can be compared to each other
but maybe that is your point
justin_smith:  Dancing is one of the greatest things a human can do
I made a triangular chessboard layout engine over the weekend:  https://github.com/prismofeverything/triangulat
Alright, time to merge all these pull requests
justin_smith:  Which of yours are ready to go?
Yeah, only put the ones you want merged up there
justin_smith:  Which one?
I was going to test his out not
*now
Yeah, that one was suspicious
Aha!
Ah, you should be fine.   I will work on improving the algorithm…. at some point
Ouch

I am up for indian or hawaiian
Or robo even
It is done
I can drive
Ready to go?
That sounds plausible
justin_smith:  What are you seeing?
Ah
You are correct
I have some version pushes
to make
Not sure
I think you can just pass in the port actually
lein run 38383
Yeah, that should work
Me too!
justin_smith:  Meeting Robby at robotaco a little later
quile:  Robo?
justin_smith:  Alright, I'll let you know
Whoa!
That site is down
30hz is rough
Otherwise, awesome
I just mean 30hz in noticeable
Dude!  go for it
Dude, I don't know how you could make them any tinier
Even the walls
world
in
Demon
Daedalus
Anybody have a good title for a caribou talk?
Lunch
Caribou:  Lunch
Yes, about lunch… !
quile:  You down for lunch today?
Indian buffet?
Yeah!
I'll see
We went there
It was okay
Yeah the day you were absent?
quile:  No car today, can you drive?
We can go to UPS
Ah okay!  Let me see if I can wrangle
No, I acquired car!
everything is in order
Ready to go then?
Let's get there before they run out of food ; )
Ah okay
Okay
Here is the link:  http://geekz.co.uk/lovesraymond/archives
seems to be down : (
Awesome!

That's where they start
quile:  Do you have a second to check out this admin js issue?
Timepicker
I did
Now J5 is seeing the issue again
http://weareinstrument.com:81/_admin/admin/global/content/models/project/71/edit
That is what I thought
but I'm not sure how
I asked him to come on here
There he is
Welcome!
So before, it had an error on trying to detect opera
so it can't be using the old version of the lib
JToTheFive:  Your fields.js differs from what I see in the caribou-admin develop branch
Specifically, on weareinstrument.com:81 it has timePIcker, and in our branch in says timepicker (lowercase p)
Which is a change I made to get it working
Somehow that file has reverted?
But it is correct in the repo
Yeah, so how is fields.js different from the repo?
Yeah
Yeah, if not, I don't know how else it would change!
black magic
OR:  don't shadow that file if you aren't changing it?
Or do you have changes there?
Is that a fix that needs to go in the mainline admin repo?
Looks like a check for nil
What breaks if that isn't checked?
dammit nil!  Why do you break everything!
We should generally disallow nil
and solve every programming bug ever in the history of mankind
Alright!  problem solved
Truly
(much rejoicing)
Ah, ride is leaving
I'll finish this tonight
I love tearing things apart
LOVE IT
Aha!
Radical
Am I linked in to you?
That guy was a weirdo
who never spoke
Yeah!  The true brauhaus experience
That is a good call though, I should find those randoms
justin_smith:  There is a nice symmetry there
Every time "total eclipse of the heart" comes on the speakers I actually see feces burbling out of the speaker grates
I just linked in every person I know
True
But the phenomenon persists
It is not me, it's the speakers!
The speakers do not lie
Hawaiian I believe?
Ha!  congratulations
I just finished (and started) lathe of heaven this weekend
Have you read that one?
Maybe I mentioned it already
So would you recommend 1Q84?
It is a hilarious book
Yeah, visions of future from the past
justin_smith:  I can't see that event
it says I must be logged in
Do you have another link?
Ah, awesome!
Somehow I have all kinds of things going on this sunday
I may be able to make it later though
Yeah send an invite
thanks
That is a good one
justin_smith quile:  food soon?
Today I learned my head is a sphere
FOOD
Yep, peace out guys
off to keep butterflies, my true calling
Ah, how was the late now?
Did it exceed your expectations?
There we go
quile:  Did you figure out that date thing on the new admin?
Watching this wackiness btw… WTF?
How did it take me this long to discover monty python?
IPIP D
I don't blame him
What are HEAD routes for?
(exposing my ignorance)
that stuff can be Dangerous
That is not what it is on my machine
Yeah
Maybe an example for each OS
Mayhap
That is quite a stark vision
Wow
link?
Okay, it is done
All new versions pushed
Routing and handlers completely overhauled, gutted and simplified
justin_smith:  Well, I really feel like cljs offers everything we are looking for
But yeah
we really limit who can contribute
in a way
I feel like the project should probably use it, even if just conceptually for the clojure community
but if we want help from people around here, it should be js
So, undecided?
neildf1:  That book does look pretty cool
justin_smith:  In the long run, the core.async stuff will really help us
it would be a good way to structure everything
rather than the spaghetti javascript turns into
quile: Ha!  Not your javascript of course : )
quile:  How do you feel about cljs vs js in the admin?
quile:  I feel like the admin has a lot of good stuff in it
Is there a way to reuse the code, or would it benefit from taking lessons learned and doing it better from scratch?
Okay, you answered my question as I was typing it!
quile justin_smith:  Indian food today?
Aha!  How about that
its been awhile
Did yesterday deter you from going out for lunch now?  : )

Dude
Oh hey!!
IT WORKED

Right!
I always knew that
Or felt it rather
There are a lot of good moons of Jupiter
justin_smith:  Lunch?
Thai?
Interesting
Do I want 32-bit ghc or 64-bit ghc
?
How could we miss the opportunity for double xx's?
quile justin_smith:  You guys want to meet about resource?
handling?
Now for nineteen tone harmony!
"crowd-pleaser" D
Awesome, I will check it out
justin_smith:  Track is awesome!
I like its slow morph into sea of wailing
Ah, did you post the JS?
I just got in the channel
Well, it is not a number!
Lovely

Are we caught in a time loop?
What the hell is a pergola?

We need more nature checks around here
PERGOLA
It is a historic day for pergola
I think Coryna did it
Not sure though
quile:  I just heard someone say it was cool time
I heard them
What is that?
