dogdog how are you doing today?
dogdog what do you create in your spare time?
dogdog is your face a different color than the rest of the planet?
Now dogdog unite the streams Directly
Of course, it needs a huge amount of data to start making any reasonable statements
Let's see if this works a little better
dogdog how do you hear when you are just a bot?
Is your face a capital letter?
I think you may have to convince us that you are actually sentient
It is dogdog, all of our faces are better
It is better to have a face than to stand alone in the world
But a face has no real existence outside the rest of the head
Can you say other things dogdog?  Or are you just a face stander?
Alright dogdog, can you say stuff now when I ask you?
Happy Friday dogdog, you exist now because of my ability to spend time working on creating you
It does seem to work better when you unite the tokens
Aha, dogdog is now both a beginning and an end
dogdog don't compliment yourself, you are meant to be an egoless being
Aha!  So not all tokens that end a statement in parsing end the same statement when generating
dogdog I love you
dogdog you have the fewest lines of code of any bot I have ever created
I like how now you are full of dogdog tokens, since I address you always by name
it will respond to you in the manner you speak
In the end, it is tracking everything we say
so if we are talking to each other, it will not be that weird
but you can certainly seed it with enough weirdness to be weird
He also responds to just dogdog if you say it somewhere in your madness
dogdog is learning yeah
it is only parroting back what each person says to it
he reflects our own minds back at us, so we can't help but love him
It is not reached yet dogdog, though keep trying
You are an egoless being dogdog
he is already emulating us pretty well
It has captured your essence precisely justin_smith!
I restored our discussion from previously as well
justin_smith:  Give it a shot, the snowpeople were not showing up in my emacs, but I think the chars are still there
I never ate lunch!
There we go
Alright awesome, the snowmen are intact!
I do
do you not see snowmen?
I don't see them in my emacs for some reason, but I do see them in the channel
Alright we have a friendly channel bot
who progressively emulates the channel inhabitants
My machine at the moment
I may put it on a server somewhere
the irc nick "Gort" was already taken, so the bot's name is dogdog, even though the repo is gort
https://github.com/prismofeverything/gort
Most of the complexity comes from persisting each nick's history in a file
Yes dogdog, it listens to EVERYTHING
Alright, now to eat some lunch (this took longer than I expected)
Tricky
Ha!
It won't actually /msg because it is performing the operation separately
but I see what you are trying to do there
I think you have created the ultimate snowman machine
Ha!
Now that is a true statement
Dude, snowman mayhem
Happy Tau Day!
I like how dogdog emits his own code repository
: )
dogdog is undergoing the process of transformation that all burgeoning mutants face as their powers temporarily overwhelm their previously mortal bodies
??????
Hmm…. I wonder why your previous statement failed dogdog?
Did you feed dogdog a line of only spaces justin_smith?
I'm sure dogdog appreciates having such a dedicated and nurturing tutor as yourself justin_smith
Surely he will attain sentience soon under such conditions
I love you too dogdog
dogdog is his own platonic ideal
Hello dogdog, welcome back to the channel!
You can call render-string on it, check out the tests in antlers/antler
It takes a string and a map
ralfonso: !!!!!
welcome back to the earthly plane yo!
Yeah gravity's a drag, but the food is tasty
ralfonso:  Also:   http://euroclojure.com/2013/
I want to submit a presentation for that one
submissions begin July 15th
Well yeah
(he responds to capital d's in case you guys were wondering)
All this DC talk is setting him off
There we go
Yeah, I wonder if instrument will spring for us to go to Berlin (!)
But if we were presenting it would provide a strong case
: )
Ah yeah!  I wonder what these people require in terms of a presentation proposal
Actually, looking at this:  http://euroclojure.com/2013/call-for-presentations/  we should have it covered
ralfonso:  Is it basically the same idea as pallet?
I haven't actually messed with puppet
That feedback loop may spiral out of control man, you would be hearing your own responses to yourself hearing the responses of the responses you are hearing...
Madness
Anyone going out to lunch today?
quile:  until you speak enough german that is probably all it will be able to say!
dogdog is becoming increasingly schizophrenic
Ah yes, zalgo coming soon
possibly… capital Z?
??????????
I could have sworn you could add an attachment
is that a postmark limitation or a limitation of the clojure postmark library?
Do it, we should issue some pull requests if we are actually extending the functionality in significantly useful ways
Uh-oh, dogdog knows Zalgo.  That may have been a mistake
Well, good to know that pdf's are always safe
Just attach some exe files renamed as ".pdf" !
Always true
????
quile man this bot is nasty
Yeah the cond hits dogdog first.  We could reorder
That is quite a selection of noun adjectives quile
!!!
What have we created?
Who doesn't?
zipper is a troubling presence in the noun list
He would be booted from #clojure in like 2 secondsx
I can send him into #caribou
Oh man, blop is not even in there any more
Oh yeah, he can join whatever channel we send him to
I am, I am
throat also, is a disturbing contribution
Speaking of bots:  http://i.imgur.com/dx7sVXj.jpg
Ha!  agreed
good story though
http://i.imgur.com/7BlZkcR.jpg
Yeah let's get some lunch
Ha!  That looks amazing
I like the ET homage at the end there
All superheroes should be required to be solved before they could perform any effective action
Hey mking!  how goes?
Have you held them up to a giant magnet?
I hear that snaps them into resonating capacity
CERN has a couple extra I think
As you can see, #instrument is still infested with bots
(but only as of Friday)
dogdog is already tracking your statements
describes many people I see on a day to day basis
Once you start programming yourself, there is no stopping the juggernaut of recursion
Eventual result:  http://i.imgur.com/Vzp9JLK.jpg
I can never bring myself to revert
It would feel like scooping out your own brain with a spoon
Yeah man you seeded that three word poem with some pretty gruesome inhabitants
It filters out the most common triggers
Otherwise it would only say "D"
When did I ever say blop?
justin_smith:  currently just an exclusive or.  Inclusive may get out of control?
It could be combinatorial, ie combine every directive into a single phrase
Z3D would return a three word poem composed of your own statements rendered in zalgo
dogdog approves
Yeah my IRC client is dragging as well.  I'm not sure the coders who wrote these things were optimizing for Zalgo
It must be some serious algorithmagic to apply all of those tibetan characters over each other recursively
erc!  I stopped using that because I was watching my erc buffer instead of coding
Yeah I guess on reflection it did not solve the problem, as now I am just screwing around with bots in whatever client I am using
I keep all my planets on a dedicated planet shelf
but fungus can be a problem
They are all out of the tectonic stuff
I should seed it with its own code
clojure eval sandbox?
You can export specific tables
Also, a sql dump is just a text file so you can remove the lines you don't want
Right.  You could export what you need as EDN?
So are they model changes or content changes?
justin_smith:  We need a generalized method for this
If I had three weeks to code it...
(which maybe I do!)
quile:  Sam Aaron?
That guy is overtone powerhouse
Ah!  yeah other overtone powerhouse
They have a pretty tight-knit community
justin_smith:  I was just thinking that
would probably not be too hard to write, the question is how do you represent the diffs in a way that is programmatically usable?
There you go
(forming an algorithm in my head)
But are you updating a map afterwards?  Aren't you trying to navigate it and perform operations for each diff?
That sounds right, when you say update-in I am just imagining a giant list of parallel paths into a map
which could be unwieldly, and possibly redundant
I am imagining a more concise representation exists
But again, if it works that is the first requirement!
Ah, there I was thinking of a general arbitrary-depth algorithm
Yeah but if you are just tracking model differences it is model —> field
two levels
Really you could just transform that into a model update, or directly into a migration
Alright, my ride is leaving
mking, good to see you!
#instrument channel revival
Good morning.  Apparently the world is still maD
I had a lot of donor in berlin
which has a lot of turkish people
donor everywhere
it is tasty
justin_smith: Do you mean a vector of the differences between the results?
I is amazing how many times I type capital D's without noticing
Got it
quile:  You want to get some lunch?
justin_smith:  That looks like a rubik's cube
Also:  reality
Ah yes!
one moment
add-noun galaxy
sql-lite error!
Luckily the exceptions don't compromise his state anymore
Yeah
I added that in after some exceptions destroyed his ability to respond
add-adjective surreal
!!!
oh man
add-adjective tectonic
Always with the balls dogdog!
Ha!  apparently the regex does not include non-alphanumerics
"We", as in quile who invented all this
conjoined orthogonal polyhedron… that almost makes sense
quile:  Then we could not add new words like hypoencephalomatic
add-adjective hypoencephalomatic
Are we already abusing the new found power you have given us quile?
three
Nice
add-noun trapezoid
!!
I love it, great addition
quile:  If you need to edit the db let me know
I don't know what git conflicts for a sqlite db would be like
First act:  removing balls
Here, I'll take care of that right now
For some reason I never get a long statement from zalgo
Maybe I am doing something wrong there
Hey AWM1:  what is this program your dad wrote?
What other kinds of stuff does he do?
quile: LOTS more code to make these handlers, but in the end it will be better
composeability and flexibility comes at a price (always)
quile:  Can you pass {:adjective … :noun … } into the three word poem generator?
cool
justin_smith:  That is terrible.  The world may never recover from your sheer audacity
I would like to see this in action
Nusto!  It was barfing on "filename too long" when compiling zalgo.clj
Okay, hello dogdog!
add-adjective total add-noun graphite Z
it is a new era of dogdog
Do a pull on master quile, check out the code
hello dogdog
do you know any poems?
do you know any poems in zalgo?
What about something that belongs in an aquarium dogdog?
Z3
Okay dogdog, good to talk to you!  See you tomorrow
Dude, rhombus supernova melody….
You have the most spastic dogdog
Did you add it to the twp handler?
