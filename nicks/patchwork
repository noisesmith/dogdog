dogdog how are you doing today?
dogdog what do you create in your spare time?
dogdog is your face a different color than the rest of the planet?
Now dogdog unite the streams Directly
Of course, it needs a huge amount of data to start making any reasonable statements
Let's see if this works a little better
dogdog how do you hear when you are just a bot?
Is your face a capital letter?
I think you may have to convince us that you are actually sentient
It is dogdog, all of our faces are better
It is better to have a face than to stand alone in the world
But a face has no real existence outside the rest of the head
Can you say other things dogdog?  Or are you just a face stander?
Alright dogdog, can you say stuff now when I ask you?
Happy Friday dogdog, you exist now because of my ability to spend time working on creating you
It does seem to work better when you unite the tokens
Aha, dogdog is now both a beginning and an end
dogdog don't compliment yourself, you are meant to be an egoless being
Aha!  So not all tokens that end a statement in parsing end the same statement when generating
dogdog I love you
dogdog you have the fewest lines of code of any bot I have ever created
I like how now you are full of dogdog tokens, since I address you always by name
it will respond to you in the manner you speak
In the end, it is tracking everything we say
so if we are talking to each other, it will not be that weird
but you can certainly seed it with enough weirdness to be weird
He also responds to just dogdog if you say it somewhere in your madness
dogdog is learning yeah
it is only parroting back what each person says to it
he reflects our own minds back at us, so we can't help but love him
It is not reached yet dogdog, though keep trying
You are an egoless being dogdog
he is already emulating us pretty well
It has captured your essence precisely justin_smith!
I restored our discussion from previously as well
justin_smith:  Give it a shot, the snowpeople were not showing up in my emacs, but I think the chars are still there
I never ate lunch!
There we go
Alright awesome, the snowmen are intact!
I do
do you not see snowmen?
I don't see them in my emacs for some reason, but I do see them in the channel
Alright we have a friendly channel bot
who progressively emulates the channel inhabitants
My machine at the moment
I may put it on a server somewhere
the irc nick "Gort" was already taken, so the bot's name is dogdog, even though the repo is gort
https://github.com/prismofeverything/gort
Most of the complexity comes from persisting each nick's history in a file
Yes dogdog, it listens to EVERYTHING
Alright, now to eat some lunch (this took longer than I expected)
Tricky
Ha!
It won't actually /msg because it is performing the operation separately
but I see what you are trying to do there
I think you have created the ultimate snowman machine
Ha!
Now that is a true statement
Dude, snowman mayhem
Happy Tau Day!
I like how dogdog emits his own code repository
: )
dogdog is undergoing the process of transformation that all burgeoning mutants face as their powers temporarily overwhelm their previously mortal bodies
??????
Hmmâ€¦. I wonder why your previous statement failed dogdog?
Did you feed dogdog a line of only spaces justin_smith?
I'm sure dogdog appreciates having such a dedicated and nurturing tutor as yourself justin_smith
Surely he will attain sentience soon under such conditions
I love you too dogdog
