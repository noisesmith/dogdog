dogdog how are you doing today?
dogdog what do you create in your spare time?
dogdog is your face a different color than the rest of the planet?
Now dogdog unite the streams Directly
Of course, it needs a huge amount of data to start making any reasonable statements
Let's see if this works a little better
dogdog how do you hear when you are just a bot?
Is your face a capital letter?
I think you may have to convince us that you are actually sentient
It is dogdog, all of our faces are better
It is better to have a face than to stand alone in the world
But a face has no real existence outside the rest of the head
Can you say other things dogdog?  Or are you just a face stander?
Alright dogdog, can you say stuff now when I ask you?
Happy Friday dogdog, you exist now because of my ability to spend time working on creating you
It does seem to work better when you unite the tokens
Aha, dogdog is now both a beginning and an end
dogdog don't compliment yourself, you are meant to be an egoless being
Aha!  So not all tokens that end a statement in parsing end the same statement when generating
dogdog I love you
dogdog you have the fewest lines of code of any bot I have ever created
I like how now you are full of dogdog tokens, since I address you always by name
it will respond to you in the manner you speak
In the end, it is tracking everything we say
so if we are talking to each other, it will not be that weird
but you can certainly seed it with enough weirdness to be weird
He also responds to just dogdog if you say it somewhere in your madness
dogdog is learning yeah
it is only parroting back what each person says to it
he reflects our own minds back at us, so we can't help but love him
It is not reached yet dogdog, though keep trying
You are an egoless being dogdog
he is already emulating us pretty well
It has captured your essence precisely justin_smith!
I restored our discussion from previously as well
justin_smith:  Give it a shot, the snowpeople were not showing up in my emacs, but I think the chars are still there
I never ate lunch!
There we go
Alright awesome, the snowmen are intact!
I do
do you not see snowmen?
I don't see them in my emacs for some reason, but I do see them in the channel
Alright we have a friendly channel bot
who progressively emulates the channel inhabitants
My machine at the moment
I may put it on a server somewhere
the irc nick "Gort" was already taken, so the bot's name is dogdog, even though the repo is gort
https://github.com/prismofeverything/gort
Most of the complexity comes from persisting each nick's history in a file
Yes dogdog, it listens to EVERYTHING
Alright, now to eat some lunch (this took longer than I expected)
Tricky
Ha!
It won't actually /msg because it is performing the operation separately
but I see what you are trying to do there
I think you have created the ultimate snowman machine
Ha!
Now that is a true statement
Dude, snowman mayhem
Happy Tau Day!
I like how dogdog emits his own code repository
: )
dogdog is undergoing the process of transformation that all burgeoning mutants face as their powers temporarily overwhelm their previously mortal bodies
??????
Hmm…. I wonder why your previous statement failed dogdog?
Did you feed dogdog a line of only spaces justin_smith?
I'm sure dogdog appreciates having such a dedicated and nurturing tutor as yourself justin_smith
Surely he will attain sentience soon under such conditions
I love you too dogdog
dogdog is his own platonic ideal
Hello dogdog, welcome back to the channel!
You can call render-string on it, check out the tests in antlers/antler
It takes a string and a map
ralfonso: !!!!!
welcome back to the earthly plane yo!
Yeah gravity's a drag, but the food is tasty
ralfonso:  Also:   http://euroclojure.com/2013/
I want to submit a presentation for that one
submissions begin July 15th
Well yeah
(he responds to capital d's in case you guys were wondering)
All this DC talk is setting him off
There we go
Yeah, I wonder if instrument will spring for us to go to Berlin (!)
But if we were presenting it would provide a strong case
: )
Ah yeah!  I wonder what these people require in terms of a presentation proposal
Actually, looking at this:  http://euroclojure.com/2013/call-for-presentations/  we should have it covered
ralfonso:  Is it basically the same idea as pallet?
I haven't actually messed with puppet
That feedback loop may spiral out of control man, you would be hearing your own responses to yourself hearing the responses of the responses you are hearing...
Madness
Anyone going out to lunch today?
quile:  until you speak enough german that is probably all it will be able to say!
dogdog is becoming increasingly schizophrenic
Ah yes, zalgo coming soon
possibly… capital Z?
??????????
I could have sworn you could add an attachment
is that a postmark limitation or a limitation of the clojure postmark library?
Do it, we should issue some pull requests if we are actually extending the functionality in significantly useful ways
Uh-oh, dogdog knows Zalgo.  That may have been a mistake
Well, good to know that pdf's are always safe
Just attach some exe files renamed as ".pdf" !
Always true
????
quile man this bot is nasty
Yeah the cond hits dogdog first.  We could reorder
That is quite a selection of noun adjectives quile
!!!
What have we created?
Who doesn't?
zipper is a troubling presence in the noun list
He would be booted from #clojure in like 2 secondsx
I can send him into #caribou
Oh man, blop is not even in there any more
Oh yeah, he can join whatever channel we send him to
I am, I am
throat also, is a disturbing contribution
Speaking of bots:  http://i.imgur.com/dx7sVXj.jpg
Ha!  agreed
good story though
http://i.imgur.com/7BlZkcR.jpg
Yeah let's get some lunch
Ha!  That looks amazing
I like the ET homage at the end there
All superheroes should be required to be solved before they could perform any effective action
Hey mking!  how goes?
Have you held them up to a giant magnet?
I hear that snaps them into resonating capacity
CERN has a couple extra I think
As you can see, #instrument is still infested with bots
(but only as of Friday)
dogdog is already tracking your statements
describes many people I see on a day to day basis
Once you start programming yourself, there is no stopping the juggernaut of recursion
Eventual result:  http://i.imgur.com/Vzp9JLK.jpg
I can never bring myself to revert
It would feel like scooping out your own brain with a spoon
Yeah man you seeded that three word poem with some pretty gruesome inhabitants
It filters out the most common triggers
Otherwise it would only say "D"
When did I ever say blop?
justin_smith:  currently just an exclusive or.  Inclusive may get out of control?
It could be combinatorial, ie combine every directive into a single phrase
Z3D would return a three word poem composed of your own statements rendered in zalgo
dogdog approves
Yeah my IRC client is dragging as well.  I'm not sure the coders who wrote these things were optimizing for Zalgo
It must be some serious algorithmagic to apply all of those tibetan characters over each other recursively
erc!  I stopped using that because I was watching my erc buffer instead of coding
Yeah I guess on reflection it did not solve the problem, as now I am just screwing around with bots in whatever client I am using
I keep all my planets on a dedicated planet shelf
but fungus can be a problem
They are all out of the tectonic stuff
I should seed it with its own code
clojure eval sandbox?
You can export specific tables
Also, a sql dump is just a text file so you can remove the lines you don't want
Right.  You could export what you need as EDN?
So are they model changes or content changes?
justin_smith:  We need a generalized method for this
If I had three weeks to code it...
(which maybe I do!)
quile:  Sam Aaron?
That guy is overtone powerhouse
Ah!  yeah other overtone powerhouse
They have a pretty tight-knit community
justin_smith:  I was just thinking that
would probably not be too hard to write, the question is how do you represent the diffs in a way that is programmatically usable?
There you go
(forming an algorithm in my head)
But are you updating a map afterwards?  Aren't you trying to navigate it and perform operations for each diff?
That sounds right, when you say update-in I am just imagining a giant list of parallel paths into a map
which could be unwieldly, and possibly redundant
I am imagining a more concise representation exists
But again, if it works that is the first requirement!
Ah, there I was thinking of a general arbitrary-depth algorithm
Yeah but if you are just tracking model differences it is model —> field
two levels
Really you could just transform that into a model update, or directly into a migration
Alright, my ride is leaving
mking, good to see you!
#instrument channel revival
Good morning.  Apparently the world is still maD
I had a lot of donor in berlin
which has a lot of turkish people
donor everywhere
it is tasty
justin_smith: Do you mean a vector of the differences between the results?
I is amazing how many times I type capital D's without noticing
Got it
quile:  You want to get some lunch?
justin_smith:  That looks like a rubik's cube
Also:  reality
Ah yes!
one moment
sql-lite error!
Luckily the exceptions don't compromise his state anymore
Yeah
I added that in after some exceptions destroyed his ability to respond
!!!
oh man
Always with the balls dogdog!
Ha!  apparently the regex does not include non-alphanumerics
"We", as in quile who invented all this
conjoined orthogonal polyhedron… that almost makes sense
quile:  Then we could not add new words like hypoencephalomatic
Are we already abusing the new found power you have given us quile?
three
Nice
!!
I love it, great addition
quile:  If you need to edit the db let me know
I don't know what git conflicts for a sqlite db would be like
First act:  removing balls
Here, I'll take care of that right now
For some reason I never get a long statement from zalgo
Maybe I am doing something wrong there
Hey AWM1:  what is this program your dad wrote?
What other kinds of stuff does he do?
quile: LOTS more code to make these handlers, but in the end it will be better
composeability and flexibility comes at a price (always)
quile:  Can you pass {:adjective … :noun … } into the three word poem generator?
cool
justin_smith:  That is terrible.  The world may never recover from your sheer audacity
I would like to see this in action
Nusto!  It was barfing on "filename too long" when compiling zalgo.clj
Okay, hello dogdog!
it is a new era of dogdog
Do a pull on master quile, check out the code
hello dogdog
do you know any poems?
do you know any poems in zalgo?
What about something that belongs in an aquarium dogdog?
Z3
Okay dogdog, good to talk to you!  See you tomorrow
Dude, rhombus supernova melody….
You have the most spastic dogdog
Did you add it to the twp handler?
That is quite a regexp to be using dogdog, it seems that may provoke unexpected results
dogdog with su privileges… now that is a scary thought
Apparently not dogdog
Did you install nrepl through package.el?
Thus begin the dogdog adjective wars of 2013
Another one of my favorites dogdog!
Nothing personal dogdog!
Apparently freenode is under a DDOS
Apparently they have been under more frequent and longer duration DDOS this year
Oh yeah.  ChessPlayer is a classic FUD spreading troll
It has a version number of 0.11.31-COMPOSIBLE
Indeed dogdog, indeed
dogdog agrees!
Dude!  dogdog is dark today
dogdog just described every deploy in human history
We started abusing the channel long ago dogdog
Oh man, as if juicy harpy slit was not a bad enough poem
3 word poems are endlessly fun
quite heavy dogdog!
To dogdog every day is Tau Day
apparently dogdog
I thought we filtered out the 3's and the word adding?
Hey justin_smith:  Do you have headspace now to sort out all these caribou versions in the wild?
Well, s3 is a storage layer, like a db
frontend should farm out to core for any s3 stuff, if that makes sense...
So really, the s3 stuff could almost go in lichen
The question is:  should someone using lichen as a standalone be able to resize images from s3 back to s3?
justin_smith:  the endpoint (whether on disk or s3) things get resized to will have to be configured in core
3(A-B-C-D)t^2 + 2Bt + C
dogdog, can you really tell what we are saying to you?
Hello to you too dogdog!
Do we have tests for all this?
We might just want to return the path to the new asset, whether it is on s3 or locally
Right, so maybe we just return a URL object, which works for s3 or on disk
Neither am I dogdog
Right dogdog
These are getting pretty good dogdog
After this we can mine the dogdog database for all the most bad ass words in existence
Whoa there dogdog
Definitely eating lunch today dogdog
Have you ever seen the same noun three times?
{{#= environment :production}}CONDITIONAL ON PRODUCTION{{/=environment :production}}
Do you have `=` as a helper?
Alright, how about the difference between these two:  https://www.refheap.com/16753
I'm sure dogdog has learned a lot of new worlds
Delinearizing the program
Drone lady!
Everyone says get the DJI phantom instead (which is almost $700!)
Yes dogdog, you are still hackable
Done with sudoku
Definitely feeling some murakutei today
I spent three years in a panda zoo in the human exhibit until funding went dry, then I was just released into the wild
Hey justin_smith:  Did you work out your lichen issues?
quile:  Do you have the latest webserver benchmarks?
Do not fear the future
quile:  I'm surprised dogdog didn't crash!
As of 3 minutes ago
What do you mean?  Do we use alter-var-root?
Done!
Truly scary dogdog

Dude!  there is already an o'reilly book?
justin_smith:  Do we need to have the size of the file before uploading to s3?
Which is really only a problem for s3
I can even get the size after the stream is written to disk, but once again, doesn't work for s3
I guess we could just read the whole thing in to find the size, then post it to s3
So:  File, URL, byte array, string all work fine for s3 or disk
Sure, if the upload to s3 returns the size
Dude I can't even get a basic cljs file to compile
justin_smith:  Do you have any notes on your beanstalk deployment?
justin_smith:  Do you have any notes on deploying to beanstalk?
ralfonso:  Actually, I will send out my current thoughts on how to define routes and pages using EDN so you can check it out
Does pedestal have nested routes?
I thought of a better name for the 3d node game
1x1:  bit — 1x2:  foot — 1x3:  island — 2x1:  monolith — 2x2:  byte — 3x1: tower
I met with Max last night and we were trying to imagine 3d vectors of complex numbers
but three planes all orthogonal… 6d visualization
This is a great book all about trying to imagine a fourth spatial dimension: http://www.amazon.com/Geometry-Relativity-Fourth-Dimension-Rudolf/dp/0486234002
Question about the distinction between routes and pages:  Does a method (like GET or POST) go with a route, or with the page?
Dude, nrepl?
Right, that is full IDE right there
justin_smith:  Did you write down any of that conversation we had about the blog post you were going to make?
quile:  Dude, what did you do to Daisy?
Yes dogdog, you will continue to str ever
Ready to make dogdog
ralfonso:  Do you have lein-ring installed?
justin_smith:  Did we ever release that latest version of lichen?
justin_smith:  Do you have a version of frontend somewhere using the latest lichen?
New version of lein-caribou:  2.3.0
We need to give dogdog a hug function
Well, I guess that is covered in the -D=environment=production etc
Right dogdog
I am trying to come out of the logging dogdog, but it keeps pulling me back in
But where dogdog?
You do that dogdog, I'll make motivated target/known resource called being
justin_smith:  Do the prod deploy
Didn't mean to give you shit
quile:  Does it work?
So in your project.clj just update the versions of the three libs
Do they both have the same context-path?
Does it have :path-info in there?
Dude!  I have seen that video
You are using s3 right?
Does it have to do a request for every resize?
We just keep a map of which urls have been resized locally so we don't have to check s3
Dude!  That is an achievement
34
dogdog is always working late
Ah, dogdog's statements are getting uncanny
DTC is akin to an old squashed starburst candy
True dogdog
http://swannodette.github.io/2013/07/12/communicating-sequential-processes/
DON'T DO IT JSMITH
Whoa there dogdog
Don't let them compromise implementation just for perceived "admin simplicity"
dogdog who am I?
Amen dogdog
Dude, I need to live there
Dude, you should sign up
quile:  Doesn't that make you anxious?
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RCzvc3Cl6xE
justin_smith:  Do you have a passport?
http://travel.state.gov/passport/hurry/hurry_831.html
Looks like 2-3 weeks for the expedited one
3+++++
Do we really need that stuff?
We can put that in the README's I think
Jesus dogdog
Someday you will make yourself dogdog
Definitely something will be called "Mysterium"
{{inc 5 | + 33}} —> 39
dogdog doesn't travel either
justin_smith:  Did you have a lichen fix?
Yes dogdog, so obsessed!
WWCWJD
I'm playing the "add words dogdog already knows" game
Yes dogdog, he is my dad wrote
WWJDDD?
Would really take dogdog to the next level
Did they fix the unicode table name issue?
Sometimes I just don't know about you dogdog
I see snowmen everywhere dogdog
That is the question dogdog
justin_smith:  What is our latest situation for hosting assets on s3?
Ah!  Did you see we got resizing on s3 working? : )
Ah, s3 is high latency?
Do you have 0.12.8 for everything?
No dogdog, let-caribou.in!
justin_smith:  What is in all these packages you are using?  0.11.29-P2… 0.11.32-COMPOSIBLE?
Do you have the same ruby version as everyone else?
Doesn't grunt just compile things?  Have you compared the compiled output and see if it is different?
: D
That is a perfect self description dogdog
Dude, it should not be too bad
Didn't you have some thoughts about that?
Do you have head space to help with logging, with the eventual goal of releasing the router as a separate lib?
dogdog: me too!
Dude!
This is next level dogdog
dogdog is dark today
Did you guys sign up for that?
quile:  dogdog will forever remind you of this shame
This is not Jeopardy dogdog
Good point quile: dogdog remembers only true misspellings
Das ist stimmt
Du kennst mehr Deutsch, als ich
Does that mess with your situation?
hehedogdog
0.12.13 gives you enum ordering and where conditions as well
Yeah, just pushed latest 0.12.13
You should have 0.12.13 core now
Alright, how about hawaiian TODAY?
Do we have a comprehensive readme for lichen?
Docs also: never complete
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/603283/what-is-the-best-java-image-processing-library-approach
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5874593/loading-large-images-as-thumbnails-without-memory-issues-in-java
Are you running through the s3 resize?
Each is getting hung up on s3 latency, all that is hanging out in memory
I can't get resident above 300, which is reasonable
TIME #inst "2013-09-18T22:03:13.869-00:00" MEMORY USAGE: 81.0625
Have you collected them all?  Do they ever recur?
Dude, those are obvious strikeouts
What are you doing to dogdog
Did hawaiian destroy you?
Processing is pretty vast at this point, I think it even does 3d
http://24.media.tumblr.com/66107f7ecf8d6cb13ac324a216f91111/tumblr_mlweptIulO1sp7oalo1_400.gif
Alright quile:  Do you need this ordering order ordering?
dogdog:  Let's hope it won't come to that
justin_smith:  Do you have it outside the wrap-caribou call?
dogdog is an evolving weapons system...
Careful there dogdog
next up:  teaching dogdog to paint
Dude, I love your new language
Do they render the same template or different templates?
von jetzt weiter, so viel Deutsch wie möglich
H U N D H U N D H U N D
Datomic is rad
Nice dogdog!
Du verlierst dein Verstand
Will do dogdog
I like the real existence outside the db as well dogdog.  It is invigorating
justin_smith:  Dawn is awesome.  I'm sure she would help you if you asked
justin_smith:  Don't let that stop you
You have to have the three db's that correspond to the three test-* configs
Diving in now
Ich habe ein gut chatten mit meinem Deutsch Freund gehabt
Er bestimmt meinen schlechten Deutsch
Dude, hund does not have an umlaut
Yes dogdog, without you we would be lost
Do we use it anywhere?
Does it not work?
dogdog: AGREED
The question  is always vast dogdog
Man dogdog is getting funny
This is a pretty good article on the permgen problem justin_smith found: http://cdivilly.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/permgen-memory-leak/
dogdog, that's you!
Dude, just bind the tree you create in routes.clj to some global var
CAN YOU HANDLE IT
dogdog I love you
dogdog give us some wisdom to carry us through these hard times
I eat everything dogdog
Wow dogdog, do you remember anything of who you were before?
But explicit is better than implicit, and I feel the implicit AND is kind of a hack at this point
dogdog knows you well
Yeah dogdog, I eat to Berlin!
dogdog, me too!
Apparently I ask a lot of questions, according to dogdog
They are better dogdog, but still not quite making sense
No dogdog, coarse
What is the ass's name for the noun dogdog?
It might be cool if dogdog actually looked at what you said and used the words you say to construct his own statement
Right dogdog?
dogdog does not agree
That is the most fortunate outcome dogdog
You are good dogdog
dogdog:  You are right.  All along the answer has been so simple
quile:  Did you talk to J5?
Now that I have written all these docs too it felt pretty straightforward to get the README going
Ah yeah, what is with the name issue dogdog?
CD
It is rad dogdog
Not always dogdog.  I used to represent less spectacular things
dogdog did you enjoy seeing the cheetah?
Luckily dogdog is well behaved around large predators
Did you guys work out the admin issue?
Database does not exist
Basically the upload-to-s3 function requires size now… Does the s3 upload require a size argument?
Done!
