now*
ahhhh, I see now
I was just reading the blog post
figured i'd mess around
I just read you blog from time to time
I'm a developer at a small agency in Minneapolis
mostly front end, but I love learning new shit
for client stuff, usually PHP, but been doing node stuff on the side
along with arduino
nope, i've heard of closure, never looked at it
what's the word with closure
besides closures
woops
hmmm, interesting
I also know nothing about jvm / java
cool
I'll have to check it out at some point
yea, the last arduino project was with node
no kidding
the project was a site where users could control bots in our office
not anymore :P
it was a holiday project
here's a screenshot, from the setup http://mono-1.com/us/let%E2%80%99s-keep-ringing-in-the-new-year/
we had about 10 different "party bots"
all hooked up to high voltage relays
and then to node.ks
node.js*
ha, yea, it was pretty awesome
except for the people who sat next to it
it was loud
hahahahah
