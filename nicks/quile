the next feature is to allow any users to add adjectives and nouns
so we can expand its vocabulary

nice
we should have it chain them
so it can respond to all of them
so 3D would give you a three word poem and a markov chain

I think colloquy can't really handle a lot of Zalgo
it slows down a lot when there is Zalgo in its scrollback buffer
All unit tests should incorporate Zalgo testing.

I am trying to figure out how to use it
ahhhh ok awesome
i just found the config where you set it up
haha

poocafe: isAuthorized directive works great!  I realigned the naming in the class and tests too
thanks for implementing that
hahaha

"placid donair vision" is a brilliant 3 w p

i think it catches the exception, no?
hahahaha
justin_smith: no hyphens
group-theory is a compound noun, we don't like those in 3wps.
i need to add a spell-check to any words added to the vocab
well, hang on...
yeah you're right
hahahah!
hahahahha
agrh!
spelling error!
patchwork: I will add a remove-noun and remove-adjective setup
then we can all edit the db
let's get the handler-chain set up and then we can easily write plugins
yikes
!!
patchwork: i believe so yes... give it a go.  i am pretty sure i tried that
well, clearly you were meant to play the church organ then
can't wait for null and nil in the same poem
and generates a poem with it, then removes it

it was joked about on the Daily Show yesterday
we're using tika for DTC
patchwork: as I work on this DTC stuff, I realise that a very useful/important feature that we should add to Caribou is an event log that tracks everything that happens (within reason).
to a DB table?
we really do need it - i'm making one for DTC now
indeed, but not sure exactly when, might be a bit later than usual depending on DTC tickets
wow: http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/08/time-is-a-dimension/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+colossal+%28Colossal%29

Now it's Yes vs. Beethoven.
Yes will never win.
Now it's Madness vs. Beethoven.
MADNESS I SAY
Definitely.  We should have another instance of the bot with a different trigger, and then they can trigger each other
well that's a bit frightening.
nice
Speaking of sado-masochism...
ha
not sure
He has joined team F.U.N!
hmm, there's no easy way to disable the indexing function in caribou core!
small oversight there on my part... ooops.
ok cool... but it should be a config thing
will have to figure that out
hmmm, not sure, should be obvious from front-end... let me check

i noticed
yeah that's what i was saying.  fewer dicks than other channels for sure.  but still too many dicks.

the image selection is hilarious
i'm about 2/3rds of the way througj

"now" is sometimes "cool time" but not always.
I am of the opinion that "now" is a good time to enjoy hawaii.
No, zinio has no attachments!
yes!  good call justin_smith
There's some very clever stuff here: http://www.b3ta.com/challenge/hollywood-internet/
hey patchwork: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/index.html
you get methods using the reflection API!
yeah it's because they are obsessed with interfaces
anbd you're never actually looking at the fucking concrete objects that you need
yeah it's the only way to do things in java
there's an awful lot of gof patterns
there needs to be a word for it
gangst?

I had never checked out #antler before
Yeah let's not go too hot and heavy

yeah looks like it's the bullet points
isn't stuart sierra also the guy who fucked up the json stuff?
bad open source citizen
3!
yes
Piano sonata is fucking unreal
noice
no, but i only checked the first few pages in the docs
hmmm, look: http://caribou.github.io/caribou/
stale... how do we take that down?
The new roadmap page is great.  It also has the same spacing issue, I see
There's no clojure in DTC
Yes, kebab concept.
FYI I got the resource handling working sans ear-muffed binding, and it works great in a caribou app
next step is to get it to do smart manipulation of said resources
but even the first step is great, because it means a partial can say {{add-resource :javascript "foo.js"}} and it will be stuffed into the header or footer or whatever in the correct load order, and only once, even if it's included somewhere else
oh shit!
justin_smith: There are no bugs in DTC.
HAHAHAHAH
Yep, i think so
have to make it fairly quick
but i can go
indian would be good
yes, totally, at cool-time
justin_smith: do you know Penderecki's qtts?
WRONG
you have to tell me when cool time is, and I will TOTALLY judge you based on your answer
exactly!
ok , since i am cool, i will come and judge.

MAHLER'S 9TH IS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.
nice
super swamped... don't have time to check it out right now sorry :(
doubt it's in the js
one sec
check in the controller models.clj for where it calls template/find-template because i bet that's your prob
there are numerous places where it locates the templates using that
fix that up and you're good
although really if you're in there moving stuff, the template root for admin should be a config setting
so we can pull templates from everywhere
hmm, not sure then
weird
possible i guess
yeah it's a shame you aren't here to show me the problem
bad timing
!
hang on, let me take 2 secs
ok, so where do you see a problem?  everything seems to be working for me
you mentioned assets?
I just uploaded a new asset, was able to change assets
hmmm
yep
I'm on namespaced-templates
ran the server
and was able to edit content, upload assets, choose other assets...
that doesn't mean everything's working!
hahaha no, there's something wrong if you're seeing weird behaviour
yes maybe
haha yes!
i fucking love that thread in the clojure group about web dev.
The python/django guy seems like a bit of a standard python/django dbag tho
I have lived in both worlds
The "django has such amazing tools" thing makes me want to vomit
and the dude claiming that virtualenv is better than lein because he doesn't need to edit a file shows me that he's fucking clueless
virtualenv is a total unmitigated disaster
giant bandaid on a huge fuckup
Loved both your responses to that thread.  I had half a mind to bring the whole thing into the gutter with a single line post, like "Django sucks.  Fuck the pony."

what's not serializable in model/models?
I've never been happy with model/models to begin with - maybe it's time to change it.
thanks, hamlet.

brilliant!
so good
you only need to indicate a change, not the change itself
the app can reinflate the models map from the DB
can't we just have an avout atom that holds flags?
let avout sort out the coordination
check the flags on certain ops
(gather, update, create etc)
don't we just need booleans?
the guy is such a dbag
well done in keeping your cool.
i would have told him to go fuck himself
fine, maybe renaming schmetterling is a good idea
but fuck the nrepl thing
me neither
yeah don't worry about it - unless he wants to explain in detail how it should work
nice
yeah i saw that
sure, but doesn't he miss the point about template-not-found being trapped for friendliness' sake?
yeah that's what I thought - that's a useful thing to trap for us
yeah
That's deep.

I know, it sucks.

whenever you yank lines, they're put into an anonymous buffer
i think so - i never use that functionality but I'm fairly sure it can work that way

we're getting lunch brought in for us so I'm out

patchwork: are you going to respond to the dude who emailed caribou@?  I figured you might want to tell him about the caribou.io stuff.
ah schweet
i like his attitude
well, i've been toying with a lein plugin that will examine an existing DB schema and convert it to be a caribou-ready DB
yeah i'll do it in my spare time.
ha.
I love usvsth3m.  It's the new b3ta.
exactly
A MULTIMETHOD?!?!
Is that our only one?
awesome
we should have one of everything.
haha
Do we have an enterprise Java bean?
hahaha
I love it
reified beans!
justin_smith: I tried your macro trick last night
didn't work - turns out it's not possible to do it even with macros
so your trick works great *if* the class name is passed in as a literal string
but in my case, it's a symbol
so no go
no, there's no way to do it with macros
i researched it on stackoverflow
turns out it's happened to others
and there's a cool solution
where you dynamically build a constructor using reflection
no, sorry, eval
but you only do it once
you don't need reflection on a record because they are all the same!
they all have the same ctors
so it builds one factory for each type of record
and then those can be switched on dynamically
it's a cool solution and works great
it's a shame because your macro solution would have been way more elegant
i'll show you... you might even be able to simplify it
i get so little time to work on this stuff that it's hard to bite off any chunk more than solving one tiny problem at a time
oh ha
i just meant in life in general
outside of work i hardly have time to work on anything else
not so much specifically this nike thing
i like it
Every now and then it has to be randomly interrupted by ChildScreamingException
hahahaha
ahaha
uh oh
hahaha
No, it's right. EDN is not the END.
EDN is the END then?
last night in my "spare time" i managed to make some progress on minification of resources
haha
nice homey!
I am disturbed.  I just checked github and looked at the commit graphs for caribou.  I'm not on any of them!
This makes me sad, because it looks like I haven't contributed :(
Even caribou admin doesn't show me :(
Looks like it only looks at master
Feigner has more contributions than me!
Yeah I don't know what's going on.  Rsrppsprprprprprprprpprrprprprp!
I think we can set the default branch for the graphs feature
but it means changing the "default branch" in the project settings
and I'm not sure if that will eff things up for anything else
very infrequently, but I have
you guys tend to roll the releases
it's bizarre
ha might be a good thing, to keep us all fresh on the process.
Nice.
They have running water in the third world, you just can't drink it.
hahaha
hahahaha
haha
hey, sorry, totally swamped
just remember that weareinstrument is running a super super old version of everything
i doubt there's a join table for it, at least not to blog
yeah but he clearly didn't read much about caribou
it does all the things he wants
yeah sorry, bit of a shitstorm
whazzup?
yeah justin_smith sorry, yes, shit, I'm sure we can think of tons of cool stuff
shit dude, that's gnar
hahaha i'll tell you later
nah it's cool, we're in control
that's very cool
i'm glad it wasn't bad - a childhood friend was killed slipping on his bike.  It's serious shiz.
this morning was weird - freezing fog.
I love the idea of a lunch vacation
hhHAH AH AH AHA stop
Free lunch. One of the few benefits of working on this Nike shiz.
Isn't our plan a superset of Providence?  You could go to Providence near your place, then go home, take drugs, sleep!
Yeah but I think their in-network thing is a superset of Providence
ask Dawn?
Emergency room visits are expensive though
(I have had plenty) so if there's an urgent care clinic, it's better to go there
if you want to save $100 or so
still, your ribs are worth more than $100!
ouch
yo patchwork just looked at that page in the weareinstrument admin.  wtf? it's crapping out with a hilarious JS error in jquery.timepicker
wtf!?
that's breaking all the other JS, it seems
debugging a months-old version of admin is not fun.  can we get that thing upgraded already?
eh? wtf!
ahhh ok
it
s yacking inside that timepicker
which is a jquery plugin
it's being called from line 41 of our fields.js
which is what instantiates the timepicker
but we are calling it correctly!
Cannot read property 'opera' of undefined
!!!
hilarious!
tell me about it!
of course!
ah wait, maybe chrome changed
it's doing browser detection inside timepicker
and checking for opera
wtf?!
could that timepicker thing have become upgraded or something?
I am a bit swamped to look for a workaround right now but can re-investigate in a few hours
besides, any workaround will require a new admin build, prob
sory
yeah something did - it could be that Chrome has revved and it's causing the browser detection to misbehave
I've definitely never seen that bug!
what is Zalgo
haha
oh sure, but how did jquery get updated?
we should upgrade timepicker in the admin then.
damn dependencies!
hahaha

can you drive?
i need to go to UPS so might drive separately
so you guys don't have to be dragged along
patchwork didn't have quite the experience i did
i just have boxes in my car to go to UPS and was hoping to do it at lunchtime
ok, but it's not just a quick drop-off; I have to buy a box and package something up
sorry
sweet.  we can drive sep and then i can go to UPS and not hold you guys up

I love the self-defining comic to match the GNU acronym
that is awesome!!
sure
what issue?
huh?
i thought you upgraded the versions and it worked again?
he's probably undone some change that you made
checking
ok, looks like the date/time stuff isn't loaded
yep
somehow it got changed
lowercase is correct
it loads, but the method invocation is wrong
it should call timepicker(...)
not timePicker(...)
ah is this an overridden js file?
there you go
cany ou check?  that would explain the prob
just blow away the shadow file
memory doesn't serve about that change
can't remember why we applied it to teague
hang on
shift-refresh your browser, maybe cached js
you can see my commits: https://github.com/caribou/caribou-admin/commits/image-format

justin_smith: ran into a fun head-retention memory leak in clojure over the weekend
apparently this retains the head (let [foo (line-seq some-buf)] (do-something foo))
but this doesn't: (do-something (line-seq some-buf))
yeah but it should be optimised to the same thing
yeah, i just found that out...
for the most part it doesn't actually ever matter
but when it comes to lazy stuff, it can be crucial!
ha
i'm sure 1.6 will be better
there are some serious nerds working on it
boo
ah yes
maybe
... or not
yeah
anyway, it's such as easy fix; the moral of the story is be fucking careful with lazy seqs
patchwork: i got linked-in friended by that totally hairless Finnish dude that you were regaling with stories of animal communication

That was some fun shit.  Prague will be epic.

brown notes?
Surely C Sound could make a brown note for you
CSound i mean
I'm pretty sure that's not true.  I've heard music that really gives me the urge to poop.
Oh wait, that's because it's terrible.
There is much worse music than "Total Eclipse of the Heart"
On the grand unified scale of shit music, that's not even close to bottom
Just listen to the top 20 on a pop or hiphop station
your mind will melt
Your poop threshold is set too high
justin_smith: read "Midnight's Children" first, and then "The Satanic Verses"
yes! I read the same thing
hilarious
patchwork: i am about half way through Lies, Incorporated.  I have to read in short snippets whenever I can grab a few minutes here and there.  Loving it.

How about some John Cage?
or some Debussy?
that's my job.
in my defense, the javscript is not particularly spaghetti
there are definitely some parts that could use some work, mostly the friggin async stuff
which js sucks at
well, for me it's less of a question of cljs vs js and more a question of whether or not we scrub everything and start from scratch
justin_smith: i don't think it would help with regards to the way the JS is structured.
it's a very OO way of working, which will not lend itself well to bridging via cljs
i feel like we'd end up with a bigger mess
patchwork: sure but my feeling would be to start over
if we want to make a large improvement

oh, both are accepted

let's do it
hang on
justin_smith: nice work on the JS!
prob don't need the anon fn for signum, right?
oh there's no need for it to be a fn because you have cents already
var signum = (cents < 0) ? '' : '+';
oh sure, you could def do that for reusability
but as it is now it only exists in the scope of the steps_data fn
no, it's rad... reminds of Chris Ford's fns in his overtone talk
v cool
oh noes!
it means you will forever be doomed to explain monads to others
hahah
i have a 3wp for you guys
imminent hawaiian consumption
justin_smith, it may be a new classic 3wp
it's probably the CommonJS "require" system?
var foo = require("some-js-file")
yep, that's what it uses
example: https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/injectme.js
or https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/tweets.js

justin_smith: how was the party?
sorry we had to bail
hahahahahahaha perfect
yeah i bet his neighbourhood was like mine... a bit dodgy for driving/walking
yep met annie a few times
it was still ankle-deep crusty icy snow on all the roads in sellwood
yeah it was a bit nasty
but we could have made it except Tara's parents couldn't get out of their house
to come and babysit
Ooooh ok, wine is a weakness for sure...
actually, there is great stuff that definitely compares to Beethoven
If you want stuff that is very much in Beethoven's vein/spirit then I can definitely suggest some paths to take that won't stray too far from the awesomeness you like
Some dudes wrote in Beethoven's style when they were young... Wagner's Symphony in C is a dead ringer for middle period Beethoven.
Mendelssohn's String Quartet in A minor is fucking brilliant and very much influenced by Beethoven's late qtts
One of my favourite barely-post-Beethoven composers is Charles-Valentin Alkan.  He was a bit nuts and a total recluse but wrote some awesome stuff.
Lots of piano music but some chamber stuff too.
His Piano stuff really pushed the envelope of what's possible with two hands.
YES!
hahahaha
is it fun/good?
awesome
ouch
DOGDOG!!!
awesome
and justin_smith hasn't crashed it yet
The Beethoven 7 last night was dope.   The Lutoslawski symphony was very cool, I think you would have dug it.
D!
D!
hahaha
Hmmmm dunno if I feel like Indian today, I think I'll pass
I have to go to the bank, too, so I was thinking of running over there at lunchtime
have to pass this time!
Dude, I am totally down with some serious Methods from the admin.
don't you have to use :gen-class if you want to run it inside a jar?
i have a vague recollection of that
from my first hacking on clojure years ago
I forget... surely SO will know
something in my gut says that, but I can't remember why
Well, what IS free will?
hahaha
You could do exactly the same experiment with mice and hamsters
it would be interesting to see which animals seem to be able to learn to move themselves around for rewards
you could build an obstacle course with power-ups and if they roll over them, they get a treat
it'd be like Mario for rodents
DOGODOGODOGODOGODOGDOGODGGG

oh shit!  lemurs are my favourite.
i think so
are they going to show it at OMSI?
we should totally go
Omnimax?  Or just curved screens?
I think it's a different projection of an imax film, same physical format but different projection system
hahaha
to project onto a wquarter sphere
yeah
when I lived in Toronto I got to see the awesome stuff on the Omnimax screens, because that's ground zero for imax.
it was a treat
Boo: http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1kwvwb/say_goodbye_to_the_omnimax_theater/

I was thinking we should hook him into the hivemind that is wikipedia
and/or reddit current events
maybe; somehow we need to extract information content from what people are talking about
and alight on the important words/topics
so maybe have him scraping reddit for interesting things
and when he notices a correlation, he could start looking things up in wikipedia
so if he knows that redditors are talking about fart videos of olympics ice skating
and if someone in the room mentions it
he knows it's current/relevant
They were last week...
http://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=fart%20olympics
well, just poll reddit forums once an hour or so and grab what's hot
and HILARIOUS!
definitely... askscience/science?  math?  classicalmusic?
or maybe we could tell him to go learn some subreddits
I have a fuel-it meeting at 11:30.  can eat after?
if you guys are raring to go, don't wait for me.  i have no idea.  it's a call with nike.

Anyone know why MtGox is selling bitcoins for $264 yet you can sell them for $600 elsewhere?
no but can't you just buy a shitload on MtGox, then sell them elsewhere and double your money?
I'm confused
well that's why I'm confused
well yeah i was curious
i'm fairly risk averse
and was not seriously contemplating it.
I refuse to be involve in anything even peripherally related to Kanye.  Except to mock him by playing the Kanye South Park episode over and over.

patchwork: did you watch that Wolfram Language video?
it's pretty insane
Wolfram is a bit of a egomaniac, but a good kind of egomaniac
It's definitely got a flavour of Spangler in there
oh, that's not cool
maybe not such a good kind of egomaniac then
I thought he was a bit more interested in making the world a better place
but maybe not
ah, weird.  fine line, I guess.
but fuck it, mathematics and software patents are bullshit
 yeah, complex character
mathematica is fucking rad
agreed
100%
Right
and in fact most mathematicians in the past would keep proofs secret for their own edification
it's actually a fairly recent thing to be so public about it
there are lots of stories of mathematicians in the 1800s having proofs but not telling people what they were.
and more stories of them THINKING they had proofs but not actually having them
because they hadn't been peer-reviewed
hahaha
yep
fuckers
But I do have this awesome proof that there are no integer solutions >2 to a^2 + b^2 = c^2.  It won't fit in this chatroom.
(classic case in point)
totally
And how can we use it from clojure?!
you can just deploy these to Wolfram's butt and run it directly from his butt
although he's British, so it would be cloud->arse or cloud->bum
food?
justin_smith: no recollection of rewriting of image tags, but it could be.  Just look in the Asset editors
hold on, i can come and take a quick look
have you guys seen this?  It's amazing. https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC/wiki/ArnoldC
It's much better than that "Shakespeare" language, IMHO
we can interop with it in clojure!
Yeah I agree, it's easy to take a set of random tokens and make them into a simple Turing-complete language
I am going to create a language that is built around your demands on toy language designers.
No prizes for guessing what the language will be called.
how so?
THE DUDE!
THE DUDE AGAIN!

Actually it came long after NeXTStep.  It was IRIX on an SGI
I used to use SGIs, so it cuts close to the bone
I dunno NeXTStep was 1989
Yeah, I was using NeXT and SGI at the same time, and the SGI machines were a pain to use compared to the NeXTs.
Although they had the awesome 3-d filesystem browser.

Those suites sound pretty damn nice on viola.
Either that, or your cello suites recording is running a bit fast.
and it's really classing up the joint.

you need a :gen-class in your class that has main
Yeah way faster!
subsequent compiles are faster I think
yeah i was using clojure.tools.cli last night
it is pretty rad
ha yeah
justin_smith: I had to take down my pronouncement about Arizona on FB.
My hyberbole was not well-read by others.
Ooops!
I said "How can we get rid of Arizona? It's got to go."
and a minor storm in a teacup resulted.
hahahah
I love this particular piece, with its hurdy-gurdy open fifths
well, now I mean the previous one
haha
hahaha
oooh that's a good on
e
ooops!
did I do that?
looks like it could have been my hackery
ohhhh hahaha
oh right!
crazy shit
RESOURCES
ok i committed and pushed.
check out the tests to get a basic idea of what's going on
But yeah the general idea would be that it should fully render a page, during which time it accumulates a list of page resources that the page will need.   Then it should manipulate those resources in some way if needed, and inject the required tags for the page to function.
but what it does in that last bit is the key to the whole thing
yeah so the transforms are built but not wired up yet
because i was hoping to implement a generic solution for specifying the pipelines
but the code is done
transforms.clj has the transforms
each takes a vector of resources and returns a vector of resournces
hahahah I forgot that Liartownuser is NSFW

Yes it is!  It's exactly the robot universe.

oh hmpf, is it on the google group?

Yeah but it's not as bad in 6 months.  At least we get to sleep that extra hour.
Kanye is such a mega-twat
I hate that guy so much.
well, we are saving that time.
for later, I guess
I feel bad for anyone who had plans for 2:30am on Sunday
because they could never have happened
i was in my basement for most of today, except for a rainy hour when I went to my accountant
I have two friends born on Feb 29th.
Poor bastards
And one of them has an apostrophe in his name (patchwork: this is Eric O'Connell, whom you know)
so he is like a walking form-validation checker
You get used to it, I guess
Definitely.
hahah
he definitely understands the import of cool time
Amazing

right now I'm dealing with some mad dev env setup
let's just say that they're about 10 years behind in terms of tool usage
Java 7 at least
but svn
never works right
I wish
i always ran into problems... maybe it's time to try it again
ok i'll do some research.
git is to svn as svn is to nothing, i feel.
Definitely not
finally, there are bodies in here.
yo!
good good, all a bit crazy but things are slowly settling down
whassup at the outpost?
Neil gave it to everyone
true
He's Typhoid Mary
isn't it libel not slander?
good good
hahaha
working at home... it's cool for now but I doubt it'll last
the work is cool; already have some commits in
learning a shitload
I haven't touched the Java stuff much yet, just tweaked the data model a bit
They are resistant to change, so it's gonna be hard to shoehorn clojure in, but I'll find a way :)
sorry, fell off the face for a bit
yeah i am working with guys I've known for 15 years
so it's cool
he wasn't here when i dropped in a few days ago!
it made me sad
sigh, he's not being very verbose today
ha!
hahaha justin_smith i knew some of that
not the gf thing!
nice work!
what's the "probably" part?
ah
well good luck
hahaha fair enough
do you know if patchwork is around on friday? or is he busy with the game thing?
i was going to tentatively suggest lunch
Don’t drink seawater.  http://dive-shield.us/infonewspages/Underthemicroscopejustasplashofseawater.html
hahaha i don’t eat seafood
definitely can
Ahhhhhhh yes, we’re back
just don’t fucking crash my mac mini, OK?
HA!
How did that happen?
I never game him ops
WTF?!
HAHAHAHA
that’s funny.  i wonder why we never noticed that before
Great to have him back!
hahahahahha
yeah but CHANGE THE FUCKING NAME, says bitemyapp
who seems to have disappeared from clojure now that everybody blocked/ignored him
I need to go and have a good P
Well now he’s bugging people over in Haskell land
They’ll get sick of him too
ok boys, I’m outta here for now… be back on later.
toodles
you too… will ping you if I find myself with free time tonight but I sincerely doubt it
33
3333
three!
yo!
I am totally three years behind
yes indeed
frightening situation
the only person I’ve ever blocked on facebook...
woah
dude, that sucks
both the recently-ex part and the bpd part
sorry :(
ouch
perhaps that’s a classic indicator - the blocking on FB
and all medical journals should be updated to include it in the diagnosis of bpd
ah crap
jesus!
everything going ok now, or still weird?
well, it’s all for the best…
ouch
haha smart move
classic hostage-negotiation tactic
turn the place into a sauna
dude that sucks.
damn
def
def… we should all meet for lunch to celebrate
when patchwork shows up we’ll make plans
ah yes, i saw you talking about that last week.  sounds brilliant!
i saw you talking about that too
sounds super fun
hahahaha
DOGDOG!
sweet
boo
same exact thing happened to me
exactlyyyyyy
meh, it was ages ago.  and i was pretty angry by then
totally.
correct
hahaha
ha amazing grace
interesting choice
i like their russian-doll theremins
yeah and it’s a pentatonic tune i think
yeah it is, just ran it through in my head…
FUCKING STOP DYING, DOGDOG
hahaha
not familiar with him no
I rest my case.
DODGODG
DOGGOD
GODGOD
GODDOG
i thought you had died forever
oh no
hahahaha serves you right!
hahaha too funny
sweet
you’re entering the 90’s!
do it
ha
https://github.com/magnars/prone
seems like Schmetterling
yeah maybe
right
meh
haven’t seen it… what is it?
ohhh right i did hear about that
cool, i’ll put it on my list
ACK! Don’t mention DTC!
hahaha
YOOOO!
Yep… def
nothing going on, really
sweet!
a week and a half
been catching up on stuff slowly but surely
yeah for sure
it was fantastic
really exhausting but that’s kind of what you expect
yeah it was so great.  i had a blast and didn’t want to leave
although i have to admit, coming home was nice
it’s just a long time to be gone
off topic, but this popped up yesterday: https://github.com/magnars/prone
thought you might be interested
ha yeah
not interactive though, is it?
justin_smith thought it was more just a pretty exception page printer
maybe it does more?
still, it’s cool but it’s no schmetterling
might be a good opp to unify them?
schmetterling is way more useful IMHO
but he’s done a lot of work on presentation
oh really?
sweet!
awesome
yeah… i’m paid by the hour so taking so much time off was bad for the bank account
i need to get rich so I can not worry about this shit!
yeah damn it, we should be rich
there are so many fuckers out there who aren’t as smart as us getting rich
oh man it would be so easy.  But you need to be rich to start that.
The weird thing is that if you have money, it’s easy to make more money
but if you don’t have any, it’s hard to get started.
yep
haha
HAHAHAHHAHA
indeed
yeah, to somehow detect words of interest
well I’m glad you think so
holy shit, he’s better already
he will become self-aware and launch the robot invasion
ha, yeah, the reality of the modern world
do you at least get to nap on couches?
excellent!!
tons of churn over at Instrument… so many people have left
I guess that’s agency life
yeah me too - everything is very tangible
yes but we all understand the difference
Did some clojurescript-on-node.js hacking last night.  It was, um, not easy.
where is everybody?
hahah check this out: reminds me of your work with uploading to S3: http://www.martinklepsch.org/posts/using-coreasync-and-transducers-for-direct-s3-upload.html
ha!!
yeah
got some shit working, but it ain’t easy
haha
hahaha ahhh poocafe lives on
I’ve always felt that the internet has needed a better name
transducers?
been fiddling with clojurescript on node.  it’s still a bit of a junk show.  it’s a killer app if they can get it to work smoothly.
haven’t looked into clojure 1.7 yet
haha
lammmme
cljs on node has the potential to change the world of async dev
so i been trolling all over to figure out where the state of the onion might be
where do i start?
whew!
so to compile for node, you set :target :nodejs in the project file
but if you have :optimizations :none
it will compile successfully but not run
so that’s one
another is testing
it’s a real, massive, giant pain to get tests to work
even with a clojurescript port of the test framework
but that port is still in cemerick’s namespace and everything has to go through him
it should be part of the cljs core
then, it’s also a pain to write shared code
so you have to use something called cljx
which is actually kind of cool, and is how *all* clj and cljs should be written
so it shouldn’t be a thing
but part of the toolchain
anyway, i’m looking into porting stuart sierra’s whole "component" stuff to cljs so you can structure a node.js app that wa
y
because that’s one of the problems with node - dependency injection and IoC
yeah exactly
it’s a bit like C pre-proc macros
dep inj in node is a bit of a wild west situation
it’s hard to go from your generic config to starting services that can talk to each other
i mean, you have to be careful about startup ordering and who can see what and how
it’s a bit noodly
so if you have a mongo db and a mysql db and a redis server
and module X needs redis and mysql
and Y needs mongo and mysql
and Z needs X and mongo
it all gets gnarly fast
hahaha
ZALGO
 FUCK, IS IT MONDAY?
DANG
Yeah, I fucking woke up today, and it was MONDAY
Rich Hickey gotta stop adding cool shit to clj
Can’t fucking keep up.
u using it from clojure?
neo4j i men
right
i find it amusing
salty and flatulence should not be in the same sentence
totally
see?
no, I totally know that - I respond with a lot of "hahaha" and "totally"
haha
see?
haha
niiice
awesome
good good ; just finished up a massive project that has made everyone very happy
things are getting pretty crazy because the season starts in a few weeks
so I will have to head to NYC for when the puck drops for the season
it’s pretty fun that way
summer is the only time we can make big sweeping changes, and I got tasked with one of those
yeah for sure
it’s a shame they’re so stuck with Java but as far as things go, it’s not terribly bad
indeed.  although bringing in clj would be possible… ask the Daily Mail - they did it
3!
hahaha yeah I’d never have taken the gig if it had been python!
DOGDOG
hahaha
DOGDOG
haha
It’s cool technology.  Might convince people to wear watches again.
I haven’t worn a watch in a decade or more
yes
hahaha
when is someone gonna produce a bluetooth hat
yes!
"foul atonal world" is brilliant
it’s almost Shakespearian
"what a foul, atonal world has such people in’t!"
hahaha
nice.
let me see if I have acquired the U2 album unwittingly...
well, it has been added to my iCloud, but it doesn’t mean it’s been downloaded
it just means I can download it if I want it
(which I don't)
woah, U2 is herpes
(and had lots of piano)
hahahaha
we had better act now then
when shall we three meet again?
in thunder, lightning or in rain?
when the hurly-burly’s done
when the battle’s lost and won.
WHERE THE PLACE?
THERE TO MEET WITH DOGDOG
hmmm, what’s downtown?
prefer a resto to a cart
yes, i remember the carts but not so much the resto situation
right right… hmmm
talking about lunch has made me hungry
brb
can’t that same thing be done with a standard gather?
i forget!
by an unbelievable coincidence, last night I met a girl from Australia who runs a software consulting biz, and is setting up a Portland office
and is looking —exclusively— for Clojure devs
yeah I have to contact her and figure out the situation but for sure
just wanted to put it on your radar
it is just http… why are you accessing it via https?
yuck, that’s wrongo.
http://caribou.github.io/caribou/docs/outline.html is fine
ewww we should fix that.  we should also get the owernship from Instrument of the domain name and hosting
yeah you’re right, we need to fix one or the other
DOGDOG!
DODODODODODODODODOGOGOGOGODODOGOODODODOGODGO

doogdoog?
DOGDOG
justin_smith: you ever tried to play this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4pGbFwC1s0
I never knew Strav wrote something for solo viola
yo justin_smith can you point me to where there’s a caribou typo? i couldn’t find it but don’t know what to search for
i checked everywhere i could remember writing caribou and it’s correct in all of those,,, ack!
Fucking weird, I keep getting dumped from IRC
Anyway, I haven’t changed anything - is it still a typo to you?  I can’t see it
yeah i guess - weird that it was typo to you.  I checked this morning and it was correct.
V strange
yeah probably I mistyped it ages ago when I entered it, then fixed it straight awat
but that had propagated to you already
ok, i sent a msg to Aussie chick… will let you know what she says.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrzMhU_4m-g
GODOGOD
ouch
that sounds painful
hahahah nice
love it
GODGOD
me too
ha
e
??
justin_smith: I met with the Aussies.  The guy, Jono, is super smart and really knows his shit
anyway, he says they have a number of projects that need people, so was asking if I could connect him with you.  I told him I had on friend who was probably abel to take on some freelance clojure work
Watching Rich Hickey’s talk from StrangeLoop on Transducers
radical
yes, I will connect you guys today
meant to do it yesterday but got sidetracked
oh nice!
they’re in LA and SF?
that’s awesome!!
awesome - keep us posted about how that goes
cool cool
meh
DOGDOG!
boring doddog
hah HA HA HA
DOGDOGGGG
yeah the transducer talk is great
so patchwork I met with the aussies
they are cool
the guy said they’ve done work using clojure + neo4j for network analysis
that might sound familiar
The guy is super smart and knows his shit
anyway, aside from his meeting with justin_smith he’s here for a couple more weeks and is down to hang out with everyone if you’re keen
you might be able to get some good info on their experiences with network analysis
rad
I’ll send out an email and we can try to meet for dinner or something?
yeah justin_smith it’s a bit of a "duh" moment for Clojure - like, this has been staring at them for years
patchwork: needs people pretty much right now - he’s meeting justin_smith
tomorrow
They
are both really likable
not too many details.  they have a series of projects right now that they are gearing up but they were a bit thin on details.
(well he said they gave up on neo4j bc it wasn’t fast enough)
yes, you can prob get good info from their exp
rolled their own in-memory for what they needed
their data set wasn’t tooooo huge
hahaha
haha
I love how everyone in #clojure was getting sanctimonious about the "type-safe languages" talk from StrangeLoop
I watched it and thought it was sort-of funny and true in a slightly mean-spirited way
but still true
Definitely not a "friendly" talk
yeah
lots of "if you don’t know why X, then you’re not a good developer"
I totally agree
hahaha yes!
or in my case, perl!
justin_smith: you’re meeting Jono today?
radical
good guy
yeah haskell dev tools are super old-skool
yeah I wrote a version of the 3wp generator in Haskell years ago and was put off by the tooling
maybe yeah, like it’s some kind of self-flagellating-albino-cult
"Life is pain, princess.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something."
haha
Canadian Haskell
you mean favour
if it’s Canadian, after all
hahaha
yes
hahaha
i don’t think so, i’m pretty crushed as it is
but i want to set up a meeting; they’re keen to meet you too
ok rad, i’ll send an email like i did for justin_smith
ha yeah!
no way!
was going to see if that ever happened
brilllllllllliant!!!
he’s a smart fucker
brilliant
great, glad it worked out
wow, people have a really low opinion of the competence of prostitutes
exactly
good luck.  say hi
yeah he talked about that
DOGDOGDOG
how so?
boo
well, you never know.
ha
patchwork: have you seen that you can now buy a small 3d printer for $399?  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MXIAALQ/ref=s9_dcbhz_bw_g328_i4_pd
apparently you can even buy it assembled for $399 from some vendors
Make: magazine did a whole issue on it this month
there are a few sub-$1000 printers that are good, they say
I really want dogdog to remember this forever: http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/22/7/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-25254-1411385269-14.jpg
hahaha
hahahaha
ha
dogdog’s three-word-poems are great today
hahaha that’s hilarious
3!
Can I have an invite!?!?!
dogdog give me a three word poem
https://github.com/quile/gravity-kraken
if only i had a project with that name
heh
hahaha
Definitely
Indeed, a great day.
DOGDOG DOG ODG ODGOODGODOGODOGDOGODGODOGODGODOGDOGD
hahaha just read #clojure
"fuck me, the frontend guy…"
justin_smith: is that teague?
jesus
man, my sentence templates are all one-word.
hahahaha
I can’t get him to say more than one word.
meh, you’re boring today.
clearly, but you’ve been training him with your D O G sentences
Zalgo
Hmm, sometimes my IRC client doesn’t render it correctly.
ZALGO!
that is rad - it has antlers
hard core in fact
hahahaha Love it.  Tim Baldridge is a smart fucker.
NO!  HOW!????!?!?!
snort snort
jesus
ahhhh hahahaha
bring it on
ewwww
dude everyone uses wordpress
everyone.
hence the problem
yeah being pwned is major suckage
it happened to us one time at idealist way back
I need to train him with longer sentences so I’m going to make a point of entering them daily.
But I have to be careful (presumably) to vary my vocabulary when I do so - otherwise he’ll just parrot the same words back at me
ahahaha
add adjective orchestral
Oh man
He’s taunting me with shorter and shorter responses.
DOGDOG
I am trying to retrain our favourite IRC bot with much longer sentences than I usually utter.
Obviously it will take some time to start having a major effect.
no cheating, it’s all part of The Game
I just have to make sure not to respond with so many short responses, and instead be a lot more verbose
so no more "hahahaha" and "ok" and "yep" and all that; much longer sentences.  That’s the ticket.
Well, exactly, that’s what I’m getting at, as I am in complete agreement with you about everything you said in your last missive.
Yes, life is a battle between either focusing one’s energy on frivolous and easy activities, or harnessing that energy for the fight against evil or artlessness.
OK, that elicited a LOL I have to admit.
OMFG this is awesome
I got a new iPhone 6, so I was testing Siri out, so I asked her "Hey Siri, what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?"
She responded immediately with "The last person that asked me that ended up in a crevasse"
yeah it was floating around the clj newsletters a while back.  very cool indeed.
Dogdog.
Yes, it’s all about averages.  I’ll continue to train him with longer and longer goop.
And I’ll also train him to use some words more than others.  Balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls.
You’re balls right.  Balls need to use the balls balls in different balls parts of speech. Balls.
You’re safe from balls intrusions.
Dogdog will not sneak his balls into too many of his balls responses.
The sound of my amusement is echoing throughout my house.
I totally agree with you.  You need to be cautious.
Good morrow to you all, friendly chatsters.  Hail and well-met.
patchwork: we talked about this particular nobbly-wobbly goody-woody spiffily-wiffily piece of software: https://docker.com/
Shit balls damn arse still batting a low average with the big dog x 2
You speak with great verity.
Your utterances are laden with words of truthiness.
yes it’s totally overflowing with juicy, beautiful greatness
Good morrow, all and sundry, whose visages please me greatly with their presence (either expected or unexpected).
This is way too consonant for justin_smith http://gizmodo.com/heres-what-the-higgs-boson-sounds-like-when-scientist-m-1642062270
Well, no, I wasn’t planning on using either in Haskell, since you asked.
Do you want to try to use it in Haskell?
Well, I think you’re associated Haskell with lunch.  And as we all know, that’s a bad idea.
Don’t you agree?
wow that looks brilliant
I went into Instrument today
They hired a new hot receptionist
and an Australian named Kyle!
Olesya is still there, they just hired another hot receptionist
They moved a lot of stuff around too, but overall the vibe was familiar.
Briefly talked to Phong and Vin, otherwise just hung with J5
Jesus, this voice recognition thing is getting nutso
I just said out loud: "Hey Siri, can you remind me to leave at 5:20pm?"
and my phone picked it up and said "OK, I’ll remind you to leave at 5:20pm."
I know.
Frightening and awesome
Oh, and I got rear-ended on my way home and my car had to be towed.  FUCK THAT.
yeah crap
well, it wasn’t a bad knock but was a pain
now my car has to be fixed and i have to deal with all the nonsense
but nobody was hurt so it’s all good
that one i’ve heard of
oh yeah totally
and poor jodi had to deal with all the nonsense too
what a fuckup that guy was
Nice to hear.  Maybe you have been learning something from people in the room.
Good good… well, as good as going to NY can be, I guess
Happy to be back on the best coast
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That is amazing
justin_smith: random numbers in Haskell is like pulling teeth
exactly
easier way I found:  ask SQLite to generate a random number for me
delegate randomness.
I think I need that on a shirt.
I work that crazy stuff too.
putting, as in golf?  or putting, as in the opposite of getting?
oh cool, Max had his baby

"fake plastic trees" is a three word poem
Although real three-word-poets steer away from plurals.

it’s so good
what a brilliant tool
HA HA HA HA AH AH AH AH AHA HA AH HA AH A AHH AHA HAHA HA H AH AH AHA
indeed it does - it’s nice to see balls balls making an appearance finally
ACK! mono-syllablic single word responses are soooooo 2013, dude
had to restart my machine to upgrade to next version of OSX
Well that’s no good!
it is!  without it, balls, I think we’d balls be balls less happy.
yo patchwork what up
i am totally down for lunch
indian sounds rad.
i got into a rear-end fender-bender a couple of weeks ago on 11th
not quite as spectacular as yours
and had no trouble at all with insurance - the guilty party’s insurance paid for all the repairs to my car.
yikes, what a clusterfuck that must have been
For me it was a series of pleasant, human interactions with very nice people at multiple insurance companies
Gonna reboot and upgrade OSX… wish me well.
.. shit, gonna wait on the upgrade.  Have to be online in 30 mins or so.
wow, that almost made sense in a perverse kind of way.

ouch
hahaha it’s not an image I want right now
this is true
ack, tomorrow not gonna work.  I can do today or Thursday or Friday
Good good
Been trying to eke out some time in the evenings for some Clojuring but failing!
Too much to do before baby arrives.  ARGH!
Yeah that’s what I expect
Lots of spare time
I know.  Something that’s time-consuming and detail-oriented.
Nov 18th or thereabouts.
awesome
one is definitely a number justin_smith
hahaha!
yes!
SEVEN
You never know when Numberwang is going to happen.
That sounded like a line from a hollywood movie/tv show that would be spoken by a "hacker" at a computer
justin_smith: good idea
right now it’s only a few lines - definitely room for improvement
hahaha
good question
Yes, sorry to chime in late - it’s definitely Stoppard over Beckett
Plus, there’s a nice Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead : Hamlet paraller
parallel
frogfish?
i mean, i know, but it’s a bit spurious
hahahaha
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
DOGDOG WILL BE EXCITED ABOUT CAPS LOCK DAY
patchwor`: what’s with the weird nick?
IRC is so weird sometimes.
So strange.
for sure!
I’m running into the sharp corners of clojurescript-on-node already …
it’s fun but we take a lot for granted in clojure that we get for free from Java
and none of that exists in cljs
for example: streams
HAHAHAHAHAHAH
OMFG
HAHAHAHAA
That is fucking priceless
I think we need to preserve that for all time.
well nobody has implemented the clojure-style stream abstraction on top of node’s streams
node’s streams are all callback-based
so you can use them, but it’s ugly
better would be to have a channel-based abstraction
Yes
That’s the whole point really - programming node.js is callback hell
so using core.async makes it all pretty
yeah but no transducers in cljs yet I think
the latest cljs?
i’ll need to look into that
yeah there’s a giant different between php guys and perl guys in my experience
jesus
but anyway, so are you saying that if i use the clj 1.7 alpha, and the latest cljs, i will have transducers?
(in cljs)
cool cool
php is a taint.  in both senses of the word.  if you have it on your resume, it will ruin you forever.  also, it is somewhere between the asshole and the balls.
whatever works for you guys
wait, are we still talking about indian?
ok
i would be down for indian or hawaiian, whatever is clever
yeah 11:30 too early
can do 12:00
awesome
sigh.

I def need to work on it a bit more - it’s like 3 lines right now
don’t use 3 - it will trigger a poem
it wrks on a per message basis, not per number
THREE
… and obviously a bit of a ladies’ man
poem please
Ah, you were avoid justin_smith.  I understand.  His D O G sentences are harsh.
hahaha
ha http://imgur.com/iE6RKKU
yeah that was one of my favourites
DOG DOG
of course you do.
jeez DD, you’re boring today
so it’s nothing to do with it being the 27th of october, DD?
ewww technical debt
boo
Sucking balls. Balls balls sucking balls.

YES!!!!
THAT’S NUMBERWANG!
Kebab yes
THE BOARD OF KEBAB
SCIENCE.
that’s deep
sweet
it’s going, just.
using React for UI, which is fun.
Angular sucks festering monkey nuts.
Dogdog can quote me on that.
hahaha
React is definitely superior IMHO
Angular is a lot of magic
All kinds of stuff you can’t control
React has hardly any magic at all
And is much faster and more sensible
yep, nailed it
You should have seen the struggles the Nike team had
AND IT’S NUMBERWANG!!
python 3? python 2.7?  python 2.8?  WHO KNOWS

playing with another clojurebot justin_smith ?
How’s this for hilarity: http://astonj.com/tech/ruby-is-about-to-get-red-hot-again/
Pretty sure it’s rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic
I’ve noticed that he keeps running but drops out of the channel quite often
so I have to kill him and start him again
It’s weird that he’d get booted while still running.
patchwork: you’ll enjoy this: http://astonj.com/tech/ruby-is-about-to-get-red-hot-again/
BECAUSE RUBY IS ABOUT TO GET RED HOT AGAIN
I can’t wait until I can program the browser in RUBY
Think what that means!!
method_missing on the browser!!
Yes, you have been this before
History will repeat itself.

Well, I always try to go on the Saturday show, because Sunday is filled with bluehairs and Monday is too late in the evening.
The problem is that all of it could be scrapped if the baby decides to arrive
so it’s hard to make solid plans
But I def want to hear Mahler FIVE LIVE
I don’t think I’ve heard it live since 1989.
exactly
Am a bit worried…
… that baby could ruin my plans!
hahah
Yeah, fuck, the fifth is so rad
Well, we could keep an eye on ticket avail - I suspect it’ll be OK to buy them on the night
or at the very least just a few days before
I’m glad you agree with me
i don’t that would be too useful for you.
I’m not really doing on cljs in the browser so no, haven’t used any of those tools
server-side cljs with node is a different beast basically
FUCK YES DOGDOG IT’S AWESOME
Well, you just need to have some fun.
Go on, be spontaneous.
hahaha totally
although honestly he’s getting a pretty traditional sense of holidays via his mother and her family
Americans make a big deal out of holidays
eg. in NZ we have nothing like Thxgiving or 4th of July - there’s no pomp and circumstance around things like that
and when we do have a longish holiday, like Easter (?!) and Xmas, people just go on vacation
and some "holidays", like Nov 11, are not really holidays in the "day off" and instead are marked with solemnity due to their origins
"day off sense"
ha, yep
definitely true - no doubt about it.
ahhh ok
he’s even mastered the "not" joke.
Yeah he’s busted some balls out a few times.

WE ALL HAVE FREE WILLY
nothing with a 3 in it can be numberwang
not in its current uber-simple form, anyway
I thought you already got numberwang
ah yes, you will.  but it takes a lot of skill and planning to get numberwang.
not just anyone can do it.
boom!
where’d smitho go?
hey
sorry i was carving a pumpkin
did you point him in my direction somehow?
I missed it - wasn’t lurking in #clojure
ok i’ll keep an eye out for him
i bet it was that the guy had to use node.js and figured it would be better to write in cljs than js
I have to say that node.js has exceptional reliability
but writing async JS is painful
so core.async is the answer
the JVM (or clojure running on it maybe) has the odd reliability issue… memory problems or socket problems or somesuch
prob more due to code written in the jvm than the jvm itself
but I have been impressed with node - it’s hard to fuck it up.
because it’s aggressuively single-threaded
Oh god this hurts my eyeballs.  http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2014/11/02/clojonic
disordered calculating oil in Haskell is better than rad
why not drop him in and see what happens?
,(int justin_smith)
FUCK
,(inc justin_smith)
(inc justin_smith)
ah ok
no comma
justin_smith: you around?
yo
so… I might have a wee bit of paid work for you if you have a bit of time in the next few days
it’s linux + audio
mostly linux
we are supposed to be demoing some of our audio matching stuff to a company in the UK
they have given us login to a machine over there that has an maudio card and 20 inputs
yeah, problematic tho
because machine has nothing on it otherwise, yet we need sox, our own maudio exec, a JVM and my clojure-based broadcaster
oh, you won’t have to repeat that, apparently the maudio card is already all set up
sorry, it’s a binary called "maudio" but is something we wrote to read an audio stream from stdin and puke out fingerprints on stdout
it seems like an old linux - do you know the redhat family
?
i am not that familiar with them
yeah, and I’m fucking clueless
cool - can i ping you tomorrow with detailed info and get you connected?
hahaha these two
rad dude
will have more info tomorrow too - we can figure something out
I’m considering attending the clojure meetup tonight… anyone else?
I don’t think EFI will be there.
cool bro, should see you there
radical - i gotta be downtown a bit early.  meet up?
NOT A HUMAN DOGDOG!
TeaZone?  Get a cuppa and some happy hour eats?
http://www.teazone.com/
hmmm says it’s only open until 6
I could meet there at 5?
Cool
justin_smith: ?
Short hike from there to Clojure meetup
YES!!!
NUMBERWANG!
… Does the what?
justin_smith: ^^ patchwork and i mentioned meeting at 5 at TeaZone
godgod
GODGOD
ok, go
just sent u some info on the server in the UK
rad
ha
yo
would love an update when you get a sec
I was working on everything last night and the server stuff and the matching of the audio is working wel now
well, sox is just what we were using to grab the audio - anything else is fine as long as the format is correct
wait where does 12 come from?
i thought the cards had 8
oh ok
yeah there are 20 spread across three cards
ohhh right
ok
can we pipe the unused ones to /dev/null
?
oh so we need something to go from 48k 32bit to 16k 16bit?
resample in sox - I am def not comfortable changing the code in the maudio exec at this point
no 8k is too low - we need 16k
haha anybot is a weirdo
huh
?
not really
:(
haha
so can you use arecord and tee to grab all the distinct streams, throw away the unused ones, and have sox instances read the others?
ok
ahhh ok
so, question:
can you run multiple arecord instances on a single card?
well consider this:
if you can run N arecord processes
then you could have a unix pipeline that goes arecord -> sox ->maudio
and then broadcaster itself could start up 20 of those
and connect to the output
from that system proc
well wait
is it possible to run sox and have it directly read from any one of the channels on any of the cards?
like, do we even need arecord?
oh
hmmm, they use alsa with these cards all the time at Kantar
so it must work
crap.  I guess I just hoped the inputs would show up as different sox devices and you could use -d to change it up
ok
seems to me that if arecord piped into sox can work, and we can run multiple of those
then that’s the way to go
that’s fine - sox isn’t too mugh of a hog, right?
great
cool cool, i’ll report to those guys on your progress
yes, I understand
well keep me posted and lemme know if you run into any roadblocks ASAP
yeah that will be tricky but we’ll figure out some way to do it.
well, the most important thing is that broadcaster sends each input up on a different channel
you can use 8 through 28
well, yes, true - it’s pretty easy to eyeball the fingerprints coming out of broadcaster to know if they’re genuine audio or not
awesome
right now broadcaster gets its channel from the config but it can be overriden on the cmd line
yes, I can def help with that
Radical
Just e-introduced you to the guys, so they’re not faceless entities
nameless rather
haha
hahaha yeah totally
patchwork:
"gustatory rhinitis" - solid diagnosis
Now I know what the problem is!
what exactly are you doing with the dec mongodb?  I don’t understand the significance
No, I get that
but why the floating point num?
It’s the condition that I have!
haha yeah it’s related to the condition people have who sweat profusely when they eat capsaicin
it’s a neurological thing where there’s crosstalk in the vagus nerve
it’s treatable but it’s not al allergy
although it turns out I have a very very mild milk allergy
too mild to be a huge factor but I was surprised to see it
Was super fun to see some cool science at work
some funky thing that numbs the nerve - very minor but apparently quite effective
we’ll see if it works!
snort!
some kind of nose spray thingy
oh dude, I’m sorry :(
what’s the prob?
schweet
ah yeah, if I remember right, sox is sensitive to ordering?
haha
sigh
radical dude, I’ll inform Paymaan and he can verify
so at this point, you are getting simultaneous fingerprints out of numerous channels
?
raddddd
well done homes
nice man
haha teeeee
so raw audio is ~/juked/raw and prints in ~/juked/processed?
yep
rad
well done dude
hmmm, I downlaoded the processed/ files and can’t get them to play - it looks like some of them have legit data in them (although some are just 0x00 and 0xff all over the show)
lemme try audacity
sorry i meant raw/
that’s what I downloaded
can’t play any of them
almost certainly pebcak
ha!  works in audacity
fantastic!
nah you’re good - something wrong with my invocation of sox to play them
worked fine in audacity
weird listening to all these British TV channels
thx dude, will make it easier for numties like me
haha well I don’t.  Those guys will be ok.
I think this is going to be pretty cool
cool
COOL
haha, anybot is case-sensitive
haha
hahaha
it’s cool but kinda hard with digits > 3
hahaha
totally
yeah it might be that easy - and rather than using *in* you just get that input stream from somewhere else
you’ll need to beef up the config to tell it how to acquire streams and which channel to broadcast on
wait - start-reference-stream is not used right now, I think
oh no it is
you’re right
so broadcaster just reads the ascii output from maudio and turns it into a line-seq
is that exactly what you’ll do, just not with *in*?
sounds like a plan
feel free to add to the config
yeah no worries
dude you’re rocking it
such a massive help
I know!  Let’s hope this comes to something, and then there’ll be more work :)
Radical - ping me tomorrow - I should be around most of the day
and lemme know if you run into any weirdness
I can help you figure out if broadcaster is working
oh ha!  thanks… it was thrown together pretty quickly
and there’s a lot to be desired
but it does its job very reliably
it’s really all line-seq that does it!
that’s a fucking piece of built-in genius right there
Rich Hickey is a god
hahah
There’ll be some other weirdness prob - the fact that a realtime stream is tied to a channel with :file "-" is a bit annoying
because it means there’s only one of them
so that will have to bend a bit
no, it comes from the config file
if you look in there, there’s a "reference" definition that has :file "-" and :channel 8 or something
that tells broadcaster that stdin is to be posted to channel 8
oh yeah bin->hex might be a bit busy, I have never revisted
but I do remember this being more complicated than it looked
because of Java’s dopey handling of signed bytes
vs unsigned bytes
yeah I can’t quite remember the details but yeah
right
I spent some time on stackoverflow looking for stuff and remember striding into a bit of a minefield
but I’m sure it should be way easier
haha yeah but way less readable.  and remember that it’s coming in as ASCII
the best thing would be to have maudio spit out binary
actual binary, i mean
and then just read the bytes
but for debugging purposes we’ve kept everything ascii
and it’s never been an issue bc performance is never an issur
e
hahaha fair enough for shiz
:)
you would have loved perl back in the day...
greatest one-liner language of all
no but I can imagine...
hahaha
yeah that would be right i think
it should map input to channel number
and you can use 8-27
actually let me find the canonical list of channels that they’re recording so we can try to map them in order
yep
same path
that’s just the endpoint that they’re posted to
I added a PDF of the TV channel list to the repo
Not sure if you’ll be able to make sense of it, but if possible we’d like to have the channels 8-27 in the right order
might be hard to figure that out, tho
so don’t sweat it too much
on the pdf?
yeah that’s all I meant
actually let me see, maybe I can get 1-20 free, hang tight
ok, I was able to set up 1-20 so use those exact numbers
I’m not sure if you can tell from that PDF which audio is which though, can you?
like, can you tell which one is BBC1?
yeah in that order
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
seriously?
schweet
of course
Clint
love it
Amazeballs… let me check the server
ok, it takes 6 minutes to accumulate enough input to post it up
has it been running that long?
hahahah
so I am not seeing it on the server
are you seeing it execute the POST?
also, just FYI, so you have some sense of what this thing does…
I added the audio of a song to audio that I’m streaming to it from my machine, which has been running for a few days using broadcaster
then Paymaan took the audio from that song and distorted it and overlaid other tracks on top of it
and when he feeds that distorted audio to the system
it locates the song at the exact time I played it
even though the audio it’s using to locate is heavily distorted
=> big win
it plucks it out of 48 hours of continuous audio, no problemo
hahaha you’re on fire with numberwang
stuff is arriving at the server
No we have no idea which channels on their list map to which channels on each card
that’s the tricky bit
We can ask them if they know - but they probavbly don’t...
That’s less important - more important is that we’re getting the audio in on a consistent channel
well, that will be overkill - we only need 20
we just need to figure out which 20
and then somehow figure out which real TV channel each virtual input maps to
ok, I just made channels up to 36 for you, so you can 1-36 for those
dude they’re posting like mad!~
stop them!!!!
like crazytown, flooding server
ACK!  still happening
had to stop server
definitely still posting
flooding channels 1 and 2
hmmm how could it be 0 length if it’s waiting for N lines on a line-seq?
Ahhhh that would make sense - I saw that once before a long time ago when I stopped broadcaster - I suspect the sox process died first, and broadcaster went nuts for a bit while it was terminating
for sure
yes def
yeah that is prob the best
awesome
ok the flooding has stopped - I’ve started the server again
heh
haha
hahahah yeah it was thousands of them
poor server
hey also: could you set the date on the kantar server to be the actual time UTC?  it’s slow by about 8 or 9 minutes
which is fucking some stuff up on our server
nooooo
because we have to trust the input from the client
because the client is what ties the broadcast to a time - we have no way of knowing *when* the client actually recorded these fingerprints
so we have to trust what it tells us
no, just 8 minutes or so
now it’s wrong
by an hour
in the UK right now it’s 20:04
20:04GMT
Boom!
we might need to get it even more precise since we’ll be tying this to broadcast times, but I doubt it will matter for now
Besides, there’s always some random delay in broadcasts, whether it be satellite or streamed or free-to-air
OK, so let me know when you feel like it should be broadcasting correctly for chans 1 and 2 and I’ll verify on theserver
and then you can expand it out to more channels
ahh smart
yes, make it a multiple of 32 and we’re good to go
1440 is six minutes, 32 is 8 seconds
yeah
the phones upload in chunks of 32
and when we do live stream matching the broadcaster does 32 as well, but for this we need bigger chunks ultimately
it’s fine to test with 32 tho
i saw the chunks on the server, and it’s not flooding so that’s good
no flooding
can you be sure to reset to 1440
sweet dude
oh rad
i see them all but they’re coming too fast
like every minute
1440 is 6 minutes
ah right that’s every 32 s
yeah i see them all - can you reset to 1440 and let it run?
great
great
still coming every 32s
classic mistake, I do it all the time
yeah it’s still doing 32s
ha gotcha
yeah that’s why the config file is the first argument to the command line
!
haha
ok
this is awesome.  I saw the first batch come in, no prob
waiting for the second to make sure timing is correct
hello, dolly
second round arrived
is there any way you can also capture some slices of audio from the inputs, or is it hard given that arecord is grabbing the incoming audio
?
it would be cool to be able to use a few slices to test with
haha
yeah probably should test before going to nutso
we need to make sure that the roundtrip from the matching side works
yes but it has to be the same audio that’s gone into broadcaster
yeah that would be good tho
let’s get all channels if that’s easy
then Paymaan can download and test random bits and pieces
and see if it matches what broadcaster is sending up
NO, SHELL SCRIPTS ARE THE BEST EVAR
schweeeet
let’s get at least 6 minutes’ worth
hmmm haven’t received another batch yet - and 6 minutes have passed
ok, i saw that come through at 13:27:20
so expect the next ones at 13:33:20 or thereabouts
yeah def
no i don’t think so - agent pool is fine
we don’t care about the response really
so fire-and-forget is good
hey, didn’t receive the second batch on schedule
1440 / 32 = 45
45 * 8s = 360s or 6 minutes
is the bitrate wrong?
hmm
yeah i see no reason to doubt it - it was working great before when you weren’t recording as well
wanna take the recording out and see?
sorry, i know it’s a pain
ok cool, without the recording?
ok let’s see if it makes a diff
we’ll see…
ok first chunks arrived
i expect the next chunks around 13:52:00
yeah so it seems
weird!
totally
sorry was away from keyb
i saw a batch come in at 14:08:20
or thereabouts
ok, they came in at roughly the right time
sure, then start it back up again without the recording
so we don’t miss too much
it’s good to accumulate real audio fingerprints - makes our testing more valuable
sweet dude!
I’ll wait for a bit more data and then get Paymaan onto it
cool, although we’ll need to record all three at some point too; doesn’t matter when
grrrrreat
yeah that will help
should you be sending chunks?
ok
i got 13-24
but not 1-12
where?
yeah not part of this - it’s part of sending "meter bundles" which we don’t need to worry about
what we are sending is called "reference data", as opposed to "meter data" which is what comes in from phones/devices
yep
some of the others are coming in sporadically
5 and 6 came up
just got 3 and 9
10
so they’re coming in
just got two for channel 7
which is, well, odd
yeah it’s possible - we should def not be getting repeat posts within the 6-minute window.  You can reduce the window to debug if you want
but don’t make it too small or we won’t be able to tell
yeah cool, nw
running out to pharmacy…. bbiab
yeah man, go for broke!
radical dude
it’s fine, all good
which transient issues?
yeah it’s a bit odd for sure
wtf?!
but you’re not posting now, right?
ok, will let you know when I see it
ah yes I see 20 twice
and a few others
i see nothing > 24 - did you def add them to the config?
sweet, what was the problemo?
oh I missed that
hahah
you clearly have plasma pontiff amnesia.
amazing man, so awesome
lemme know when you have the .wavs and I’ll grab them and give them a listen
I won’t be able to test them bc I don’t have a phone with the right software but Paymaan can do it
well ideally we’ll run the audio into the matching system and it will tell us exactly when it occurred in real life
and that should correlate with the log times
oh and I’m logging the uploads on the other end
so don’t worry about that right now
hahaha
yo justin_smith
would it be possible to run the broadcaster?  or are you tweaking doing stuff?
the more data we collect, the better
ah
it hasn’t been running since yesterday
awesome, thx!
any idea what shuts it down?
ack… well, maybe just run it in a for(;;;) look
loop
haha
ah
ok
ah yeah
no sweat - I just figured you brought it down to work on something
we can also have the server detect if it’s not receiving, and ping me or something
awesome, it’s brilliant - I’ll keep it running.  just tell me if you need to work on it.
cool
totally
yeah dude no worries
justin_smith: FYI Paymaan just did a test, with the phone, of audio from BBC 1, BBC 2, ITV1 and ITV2, and it worked brilliantly
IT IS FUCKING AWESOME
wha?
fuck
thx
looks like it last uploaded at 11:34
weird
don’t worry about it today
I will keep an eye on it
awesome dude, thx!
he didn’t last
hahahah I bet
I have been abusing caffeine in such a way for just over 3 years.
yeah cool
COOL
where is anybot?
jahja
hahahah
i just expected him to say something when I said cool
amazing
Surely, that’s numberwang?
ha, cool
hah
hahaha
bots talking to each other is hilarious
yo are you working on broadcaster?
just wondering if I should be kicking it when it goes down or if it’s just down bc you’re in there beating it with a stick
I noticed that it seems to stay up for ~2 hours and then die - smells of OOM problem
ok, it’s just that it always seems to happen at the same time
things stay up for ~2 hours
and then splat
whereas i feel like buffer probs could happen any time
just a gut, could be anything of course
well it does buffer up the fingerprints in a buffer, but those should get truncated
(the fixed-length buffer was an artifact from an earlier version)
radical - don’t let me get in the way of that!
oh shit, sorry, i just went in and was fiddling - didn’t know you were doing stuff
ok cool
sweeeeet
ok
well wait, we have to be careful not to go overboard just for this demo
most important thing is that it runs and doesn’t crash
ok
I guess I’m worried about rabbit holes - it’s almost entirely correct right now, but something is killing it every 2 hours
ok cool cool
haha
right
ok cool
yo justin_smith you around?
@seen justin_smith
around now...
briefly
oh it’s no substitute for doing it the right way
but you weren’t around and they needed to test
well now that those guys are on GMT and can test on the ground with real audio, they need to be able to know that the channels are being fingerprinted, but obviously it’s not ideal if there’s a blip every hour!
but they can easily work around that for now
yeah give it a bit more time but be wary of the rabbit hole - this is just a demo so we only need to work for the demo - it’s not a production system
yeah that’s fine, but I just asked the guys whether they need more than what they’ve got now.  If the current situation is acceptable then we can hold off on further tweaking.
yeah I’ll have them loop you in on correspondence
ok - I’m gonna disappear for a bit but will check back in later.  Catch u then
yo just sat down to check in… what up?
justin_smith nope!  how about now?
yo how about now?
yo justin_smith
yo yo yo, just sending you some email
does it have to do with the other stuff that they were doing?
HA
let’s ask
one sec
i’ll skype
let’s see if we can get this sorted
maybe the card got locked up
they say no, they haven’t tried anything
w can reboot… wanna give it a go?
yeah go
yeah def
the card is still locked?
ok
is the data coming from arecord?
you mentioned fiddling with buffer sizes - did you make any changes to that?
ok
well, let’s check the pipeline first - make sure that arecord is spewing data or not
then make sure the maudio exec is fingerprinting it
then make sure broadcaster is pushing data to the server
I have to run upstairs for a sec but will be right back
Let’s just be methodical
Also, the guys said actually it’s ok for us to bring broadcaster up and down today
and they don’t care about today’s back audio
but we just need to be running reliably from tonight about midnight onwards
bbiab
no, our midnight
they’re heading into Kantar in the morning so we need to be done by 8am their time
any luck with arecord?  we can shut everything off and just go through each part in turn
I know but have you shut everything off and verified each step?  I think that’s what we need to do before anything else
ok, and then you verified that arecord is spewing out audio? or not?
ok
and you use tee to grab that and pass it to maudio, right?
let’s go back to basics and get it to work with a single channel from 1-12
Oh right, sox first
haha, a lot of numberwang going around
anyway, let’s get broadcaster listening to ^^ that pipeline
so we know the card is functioning - something else is bent somewhere in our chain
yeah but we need to prune things back to find the problem
because as you say, everything looks right
well it should be shouldn’t it?
hmm
ok
looks like you also renamed the fifos at some point?
and commented out fifo 9 on card 0?
so that’s a change too
about 8 hours ago?
yeah i see that
I’m just pointed out differences
pointing
hahaha
ls -lt of fifos
sorry ten hours ago
8 hours ago for the card-x-y-fifo
but channel 9’s fifo was last used:
2014-11-16 14:51 0-9-fifo
right, i see that we’re only using x-y-fifo
and channel 9 was last used ~10 hours ago
presumably when you removed it
from broadcaster’s config
is it possible that arecord is blocking because one of the fifos is not being drained?
and it’s getting backpressure?
let’s set broadcaster to work on all channels
and see if anything changes
try doing that, restart everyone, and see if it picks up again.  something is different about card 0, and that’s one difference
?
ha
-> backpressure!
hahaha no! don’t worry, this shit is fucking tricky, always helps to have a second pair of eyes
let’s verify it’s working, then you can go back to your newer clojure-controlled version and see if it works now
is that oK?
dude, no, thank YOU
paymaan and ravosh are so stoked to have you on the project
holy flying fucking spaghetti monster I REALLLLY hope this demo works
and they convince Kantar to give us lots of MONEY
ohhh right… you’re helping ravosh with that too, right?
we have a couple of days to get that dialled
but I won’t be available at all after tomorrow
but you seem to have things under control!
I have to run out for a bit but will be back online tonight
I know, you are a rockstar
so before you go to sleep, send me email about where you get to - so I know if I need to go in and fiddle with crontabs and stuff
YESS!
right on
are you gonna leave this guy running then?
I can play with the crontab to get it to restart without losing so much data
cool cool, thx dude
if you’re up before midnight PST lemme know
or if you do any work while I"m gone
but otherwise, go sleep
yes, I was going to diddle with that a bit
super easy solution is to restart 30 seconds after the hours
hour
then 60 seconds after the hour
then 90
or whatever
I’ll play with it
does broadcaster log stderr to anywhere?
yep but you need sleep, I’ll try not to bug
OK perf
thx man
good plan, in case
ok, catch u later
yo dude, I’m back
sounds like you’re making great prog
let me check the server and see if it looks kosher on this end
ha ok, I’ll poke around on our server and make sure it’s sending up quality fingerprints
ok great
I won’t touch anything on the kantar box
well wait - don’t try to bite too much off
rock on.  ok you’re in the driver seat on the kantar box.
HA!
he knows what we’re talking about
yeah it does so far
but it needs to stay up > 2 at least
remember that the old version died regularly around the 2 hour bmark
me too
good plan
awesome dude
keep on keeping on
hopefully it’ll make it to 3...
heh
heh yeah - def something for later if this comes to anything
We actually have the maudio code in Java too but not quite usable yet
but if it were, it could all be in a single clj process
yeah that’s the ultimate goal but it all goes tits up if we don’t make progress with Kantar I think
rock on dude
heh
THREE
cool cool
yo so I think they’re starting their stuff in London now - fingers crossed
awesome dude
let’s not touch anything :)
brilliant
I just sent email - I need to sleep but tonight I can be reached if needed.  Not so for tomorrow night, so…
cheers & thanks again, couldn’t have done this without you, no matter what happens
yo justin_smith yt?
great news on the boratcaster
sad news on the killing of box 2… what happened?
ah well c’est la vie
SuSE WTF
heheh
don’t worry, Paymaan is ok with stuff like that - it happens
what’s the status at this point with box 2?
great
you mean for box 2?
ok cool
sweet dude
yeah it’s shite innit
hahaha
well, that hardcoded path might not be used - Ravosh doesn’t even use windows
grt
sorry i’m gonna be on and off for the rest of the day
but will be checking in
hahah
speaking of system clocks - box 1 is still a minute or more off
we should fix that at some point
cool
ha
No you are not
ha
ok keep an eye on it - bc system time is critical for this work
yeah as long as it realigns itself periodically, that’s ok
yo just had a quick chat with the guys
yt justin_smith? or are you catching some zzzzs?
yeah cool - so we talked about which channels are live or not
we’re going to leave them all on, so don’t filter
(i am talking about box1 here)
I will handle filtering post-hoc
yep
well, actually, i’ll just ignore those unused channels when I build the reference data
yes, but some of the channels don’t broadcast at night
so we can’t use that right now
channel 12 is definitely live
and we have the matches to prove it - for sure it’s BBC1
anyway, all good
I don’t think so no
can’t imagine how
that should be live
yeah
hm
something up
agreed
well I
yep
ok cool
justin_smith: qq
NUMBERWANG FUCK YEAH
ok
that would explain why we’re seeing BBC1 on input 12
so it’s not wrapping around
hmmm ok
k, just wanted to be sure
ok, all good, just wanted to be sure.  it’s a classic off-by-one [mod 12] error tho, so wanted to make sure it’s not happening here
cool cool
no, but that’s not what I’m saying - i know the sox and broadcaster have all their numbers right
the thing that’s talking to the cards is arecord
ok, it’s fine - it’s just very odd that’s all
but whatever, no need to sort it out now
no i see that - i just wanted to eliminate the possibility that it’s 0indexed, not 1
but cool, you’ve been thru this, no problemo
if arecord delivered those 32-bit words and sox expects them to start at 0, not 1, so specifying 12 would give you 0
but yes, i see that you’ve gone thru everything - am just double checking
right
yeah, it would be weird
and it would have to be exactly 32 bits
but that would shift everything the right amount to give us this weird numberwang
numbering i mean
haha
ah well, i’m perfectly content right now considering it a mystery we don’t need to solve
if everything’s running fine, fuck it
but if anything comes of this, we might have to chase it more.  but right now, i’m content.
rad
undoubtedly… that will be job 1 if we get any work out of this
for sure - which is a big bonus
and has always been my goal with this side of the equation
the server side is node.js and will stay that way
but hey, there’s always cljs...
MOTHERFUCKING PROMENADE BITCHES
!!
good good.  so. fucking. tired.
he’s always confident
yeah, she’s actually a good sleeper - but doesn’t like to sleep unless she’s held
so we have to wean her off that requirement
you can, you’ve just repressed those memories.
ha yes
good - she’s recovering quickly and Callum has been so cute with his baby sister
so that’s all cool, just realllllly hard to juggle the two kids, and sleeping and getting stuff done
Tara can’t do anything at all for another week or so
So i have to do most of the driving/dishes/laundry/etc
although she’s up and about and already doing some stuff
well, i only get paid if i work
so i have taken a week off but I need to work again or we’re broke
which sucksss
I am listening to the Mussorgsky again.  This is so rocking.
Isn’t it incredible?
Oh yeah, brilliant
Bydlo?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictures_at_an_Exhibition
Yeah I knew you’d love it.
justin_smith: you talk to the guys after their time at Kantar?
i haven’t spoken to them since, like, Thurs
cool cool
But wait
Those channels were fixed to ids
on the server
ok great
whew
had visions of getting the channel mapping wrong on the server
and screwing up all their testing
brilliant
no problem since this is a demo
fingers crossed that they bite and there’s more work
fantastic
well done dude
rad
indeed!
don’t beat yourself up over it - this shit is finicky
hahahahahaha
seriously, chording sucks
exactly.  every time i try to learn emacs, I get so baffled/bemused - "surely they can’t REALLY expect me to press those keys and contort my hands in that fashion"
right
you will love the internal linguistic logic in vim
yeah it might be a best-of-both-worlds
nice
patchwork: that dover score looks badass
love their editions
and i love that the portrait of Mussorgsky even looks like a drunk
hahahaha
jinx
In mother Russia, music fuck you up.
yeah, copying lines around using
"y" is so rasy
easy
and racy
you can set a marker somewhere with mX (where X is some letter)
and then use it in your composed things, like :’X,.s/foo/bar
which means "from X to whereever the cursor is, replace foo with bar"
because the syntax of that is <range><operation><arguments>
the range is 'X,.
yeah vim seems really obtuse because it’s so terse, but the internal logic of it is brilliant
'X is "whatever marker I set called X"
so you put your cursor somewhere and say "ma"
that creates a marker called "a"
then move somewhere else
:’a,.y
-> yanks into buffer
'a,.d
'a,.s/foo/bar/g
etc
(from the : prompt)
that’s super old-skool vi
which is kinda all I know, bc I learned it so long ago, before recorded history
no, "." refers to current position
so the range 'a,. -> from marker a to the current pos
you can do 1,. or .,$ (which means here until the end of file)
yeah and other things are great like "dG" which deletes from here until end of file
or "yG" -> yank from here until end of file
also, there’s a brilliant lower-case/upper-case duality
i -> insert at cursor, I -> insert before cursor
o -> open new line after cursor
O -> open new line before cursor
p -> put buffer after cursor
P -> put buffer before cursor
etc etc
the biggest mindfuck is the command-mode/insert-mode confusion
yeah those are line based
it’s heavily line-oriented
I don’t do that, but I’m certain it can be done
you definitely work in lines and chunks of lines
yeah there’s paredit
I think you’ll find that it is not as good as emacs, obviously
justin_smith: I just made a google doc with my billable hours for each day and shared it with them
no reason not to do the same - if you want to ping them with an email first asking that question that would prob be good
I suspect they’ll just go for gdoc
DOGDOG
hahaha
nice
yeah you mentioned it
crazy
I watched a few talks from Clojure Conj last night
yeah I noticed that
seems really cool
also watched Rich Hickey’s latest transducers/core.async talk
and the one from the Aussie guy about core.async
yeah i been saving that one
i’m gonna give Cursive a try soon I think - it looks awesome
hello hello
ha
DOGDOG
I think I’m going to write a piece of music called "The Rube-Goldberg Variations"
where each successive piece is a variation on the previous piece
exactly - each one is entirely derived from the previous one
YES
brilllllliant
Yeah it’s incredible
I can’t get enough - I love revisiting pieces and hearing them anew
and Pictures is all-time
ha!  don’t think me, thank Modest M.
thank
hahahahahaaha
yeah, what a guy
total weirdo… and we’re better off because of it
There’s no such thing as being a free lunch.
dogdog, gimme a poem
deploying to clojars is easy - you just scp the jar and the pom and clojars does the rest
how was pho?
where is it?
i won’t be able to make it tonight sadly
yeah he did
justin_smith: did you see this?  http://matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/12/04/Farewell-Scala/    hilarious
hahahahha
haha
Matt Inman is brilllliant
laughing so hard at her right now
woah
omg that keynote is fucking hilarious
thanks for that
haha yep
anything with "pypy" in it makes me shudder
well, that’s what I’m trying to achieve with node.js - if the clojurescript compiler can be convincingly self-hosting, we’re almost ther
sweeeet!
yeah, faaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhcccckkk
hahaha!!!
Fantastic
radical!
oh!  radical
glad that worked out
is that the Seattle peeps?  or a different one?
sounds wicked fun
haha
did anyone go to last week’d clojerks?
cool
hahaha
big windstorm coming boys
gonna be frightfully gusty this afternoon, watch out for fallen branches and downed lines
Yeah don’t be fooled - hurricane force winds about to hit oregon coast
will be here around 3pm
hahah duck rabbit (rabbit duck?)
that should be the new religious war - a meta-war between people who all know it could be a duck or a rabbit, but who believe it’s a duck-rabbit or a rabbit-duck.
DOGDOG YOU’RE HOME!
sweet
hahahaha
DOGDOG
The force is with you
crazy cool!
no never
wait
is that the one that is a tape piece?
where the tape is copied over and over and over
ah right
so it’s just re-recorded over and over until it’s no longer intelligible/recognisable, right?
hahahaha that’s hilarious
Ikea?!
Oh I know, I like it
Food is not too bad, and the cinnamon rolls downstairs are delish
good plan… will be interested to hear what you find.  i have never found a perfect place to work around town that I’m happy with
nice
oh rad - where is it?
hmmm, I have a weird feeling I’ve walked past glyph
hmmm I don’t remember that.  Cool!
sadly i can’t… but it does look cool
i haven’t seen a movie in a theatre for two years
at least
once you have kids, there’s just no chance
yeah kennedy school too
holy crap
anything involving joaquin phoenix will probably be a bit incoherent
ha
Seems like your changes have worked
The show was good but didn’t blow me away
Pictures for Orchestra is brilliant, yet not as good as the solo piano version
Well it was fine, I enjoyed it, but nothing blew my mind.  And I love all the music on the programme; it just didn’t quite hit the spot for me
Bruch v.c. 1
I like it, but I’ve actually heard it played better
Yeah there may be a bit of that
But I’ve heard Joshua Bell play live and he lived up to expectations
and Hilary Hahn
and all the other big names
It was a good show - nothing bad
Just not mind-blowing
I enjoyed the mussorgsky but the piano version definitely rules.
The orchestration is great of course, but I think that’s the problem with it really
There’s just too much colour and it detracts from the notes themseles
^v
When you hear the progression from Bydlo -> Great Gate of Kiev
on a piano you really get that buildup and then cascade of bells and clanging
and the re-emergence of the promenade theme is so much spectacular.
^more
(not sure about recording, but if Montreal recorded it under Dutoit, I bet it’s the canonical recording)
Ohhhh, hmmmm
Ivo Pogorelich has a good one
sweeeeete
-e
what’s up with my typing today? jesusssssss
actually the pogorelich gets bad reviews on Amazon.  Demidenko is badass tho: http://www.amazon.com/Mussorgsky-Pictures-Exhibition-Prokofiev-Piano/dp/B007RV4B2S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1421171952&sr=8-2&keywords=mussorgsky+pictures+piano
and there’s always Evgeni Kissin: http://www.amazon.com/Mussorgsky-Pictures-At-An-Exhibition/dp/B00005UED7/ref=pd_sim_sbs_m_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1DTKK7KQMVQWKMQFA0EE
(it’s got to be a russian of course)
hahaha
he thought he was logged in - no errors or anything
just restarted him, but wtf
how? he’s on my desktop
how does it happen then?
fucked up
holy crap, that’s awesome
have you seen the amazing rube-goldberg machine in the OK GO video?
ha yeah
these are great but nowhere near as complex as the OK GO video IMHO but they’re very creative
it’s entirely synchronised to a song - an incredible feat
Takacs quartet?
bummer
they do, well done
ack
gross
um, check out this kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elanlee/exploding-kittens/
note the numbers…
YESSSSSSS
insane
well, they have Matt Inman doing the artwork, so it went viral
jhahaha for sure
oh ok
I thought he had it already - ah well
patchwork: yeah I saw that when it was posted.  The top reply at the time was : "Show me on the doll where the bad kiwi touched you."
I love the responses - mostly showing typical Kiwi humour
justin_smith: I love Simon Pegg but not a fan of the Star Trek reboot
Shaun of the Dead is an all-time classic
Oh dude I’ve seen all of Simon Pegg’s oeuvre :)
I still think Shaun of the Dead is the best of the three
but I love the wonderful pivot moment in The World’s End when it goes from buddy-pub-crawl-flick to alien-space-invastion-flick
I actually also enjoyed "Paul", the alien stoner film
with all its sci-fi in-jokes
but it was def a bar lower
hahahaha
there MUST be a jumping-over-a-fence gag
who/what is hodlr?  a bot?
hahahahaha that was very suspicious
hahahahahahahhaa
Amazing font choice, you mean
hahah Iceland is a supermarket chain
It’s their brand of Minge Pies
(I was confused too, then I remembered)
you’re weird
yooo
did you look up papers on STM?
Well, it could also be the creation of Rich Hickey’s subconscious.
But most likely it comes from academia
interesting
why not ask one of the clojure core team on #clojure?
yo yo yo
yoooo
yeah was in NYC
had a busy week
good good - great to be back
yeah I was
yeah tough for Tara, that’s for sure
yeah her parents were awesome
they took Callum for three nights
No - ended up going to a couple of hockey games so I missed it
hahaha work trip, sadly
it was a great trip but really tiring
Hahhaha all good
How was game day?
Oh, also: I will DEFINITELY be at your Schubertiad!
As always!
Even "easy" Bach is tricky
There is no hiding!
yeah always a battle
Oh!  Brilliant
rad
definitely
hahahha classic, they "stickied" that post on /r/newzealand
dudes
you guys thinking of attending clojure/west?
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/clojurewest-2015-april-20-22-portland-or-tickets-15132534819
Ha ok, I need to buy
I missed the early bird :(
$75 cheaper
ah well
oh cool
how are you liking pixie?
ha!
can you hash-bang it?  #!/bin/env pixie
?
rad
ha
just bought my ticket to Clojure/West
boom! bang! zap!
definitely
oh thx justin_smith but no worries - it’s tax deductible!
justin_smith: happy birthday!
i talked to patchwork about taking you out for lunch today but he’s off-site… can you do lunch tomorrow?
awesome!
where do you wanna go?
Indian? Hawaiian?
rad
hey dudes
i’m recovering from food poisoning so not too sure what I can eat
yeah it’s been 6 days now
some eggs from Trader Joe’s.
Tara got it while I was in NYC
but we didn’t think it was food poisoning.
Then I came back and got it immediately on eating eggs
turns out she ate eggs right before getting it
it was mild as far as food poisoning goes
but has messed us both up
my appetite is totally destroyed
I bet I can order something at the Indian place that will be good tho
because I am not sure if the buffet will do it
either way, yes, let’s do indian place
what time?
yeah totally
c u there
bueno
yo, how was the symphony?
yes it is
yeah i think it just gets on my nerves
yeah
plus Orff was a Nazi
i believe so
fuckers
that is fucking spectacular
patchwork: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlRK83PHQ0k
That’s part I of many parts - the guy was nutso but awesome.
Finally it seems all parts of it are back on youtube
It’s like the biggest work ever written for solo piano
Yeah wacky dude
But in some weird way the spiritual heir of Scriabin’s weirdness
yeah it’s nuts.  there’s a famous story about the first performance of this piece
it was by the guy who’s playing in the youtube videos
And while he was playing it he became feverish and developed a crazy high temp
and ended the performance wrapped in blankets and sweating profusely
fever chills - I just had them with food poisoning so I know what they’re like
nothing about that story here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_clavicembalisticum
so maybe it’s apocraphyl?
apocryphal?
apocraphyl sounds like something imaginary involved in photosynthesis
totally
haha
WHO DOESN’T LIKE TARTS?
http://imgur.com/UIrQC1h
Good lord
It’s as if they were all playing instruments tuned to different keys
I mean, the essence is there
yo
snore… ain’t got time for MRA nobs.
patchwork: how was the show?!  sorry I missed it :(
awesome!
i will make it to one sometime, I promise!
fabulous
it was great, we won 3-2 and I score two of our goals including the winner so it’s  a good thing I went
i still would have rather been at your show
!!!
yeah fuck i want to hear that
pastor of muppets - nice
hahah this one just popped up on reddit… it’s an oldie but a goodie: http://www.theonion.com/articles/atonal-composers-gather-for-atony-awards,3112/
yeah that’s a bit old
justin_smith: I spoke to Ravosh today about Juked
There’s been some movement - seems like Kantar and Juked are signing an agreement for licensing of tech
There could be more work coming in a few months - fingers crossed!
good!  I’m kinda bored
i am spinning my wheels at work a bit
they’re all freaking out over a big release and I’m detached from it all
so I’m keeping myself busy but it’s not very exciting
Using docker a lot - it’s fun
Yeah - if I were in NY i’d be in the thick of it
justin_smith: R2 merged them
but we didn’t want to
and now we don’t know what to do with them
I think we should back them out
but I’m not sure how to do it
yeah good plan
I don’t anyone will be too worried by the revert.
if it’s a problem we could always fork and revert
yeah good plan
crux is the name of the constellation
which has a nice ring to it
exactly!
Yeah it’s cool
hahaha!
but it’s not actually the way to find due south
you triangulate from it, but due south is not actually in the constellation
but still… crux!
OK, will do
Kanye always injects himself into things that don’t concern him.
I’ve heard he likes fish sticks.
Ha, when I was writing music I also used an old fountain pen
totally… and the sound it makes makes you feel like you should be writing by candlelight
and perhaps also dying of consumption
I always went for the sepia
yeah it’s nice
Janacek fucking rules.
jupiter is ascending every evening in the east.
yes, yes, i know, it’s a movie
i’m just kidding
yes i remember when that happened.  i want to get some of those shoes just so i can leave great footprints everywhere.
lunch this week?  i gotta get outta here at least once.
hawaiian?  ethiopian?
just making sure you’re still here - the net connection dropped.
no i mean exploding it rather than deploying it as a war
tomcat is hopeless - it treats wars differently than the same war exploded
which it shouldn’t - that’s the whole point
it’s not about that - it’s about tracking the problem down
explode it and see if it’s still a problem
if it is, you’ve eliminated that
no you shouldn’t have to
use wrap-file
no, although that might help you narrow the problem down
so it’s coming from a dir outside of the war?
hmmm
this seems really familiar
hmmm i got nuthin… is it documented behaviour that you can’t serve a file that ends in a .?
right, maybe it’s a problem with ring?
haha
and??
yeah that was kinda my gut feeling
i had some vague inkling of a similar bug in the past that i’d run into
nice job dude
hahahah
3!
i love the idea of a stingray hive
ewwwwwww!
what was it?
doing well - a bit bored with what I’m doing
but things are good
lunch?
yeah
hawaii or ethiopa?
maybe hawaii… craving.
radical!
yeah, unless there’s another one you wanna try?
schweeeet… what time?
12:30 works
awesome
shit, i feel like I had an errand to run and now I can’t remember what it was!
hah
what was it?
no, the three word poem i mean
hmmmm… i didn’t notice!
i think i was still laughing as his descriptions of mvmnts 2 and 4
searing!  yes!
oh, just about how there is notation for both piano and violin, but they are explicitly told not to coordinate
ahhahahahahah
aha!
I still haven’t seen it
never get to see movies these days
although I did see "What We Do In The Shadows"
Yeah I really should try to see it (Interstellar)
hahah
yeah I should try to sneak out and watch it on the big screen
hmmmm
all righty then… 12:30 @ ate-oh-ate?  i gotta get my arse into geat
gear
see you guys there?  justin_smith you in too?
^^ ate-oh-ate at 12:30?
haha ok
Any interest in impromtu lunch?
I am on the east side kinda close to Instrument but have no car
impromptu
patchwork^
?
hahahah jesus
yeah i wasn’t going to suggest because I wasn’t sure what my sched was - waiting for my car to be fixed
maybe I’ll just to Nong’s today, and we can plan a group thang later this week?
^go
haha
I prefer lunchslow
def
ouch
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
I don’t think I can today - maybe Thursday?
I’m doing an R&D project at work with Cassandra… you guys ever used?
Dogdog finds it funny
Just started looking… will give you a report!
it’s a fancy, queryable kv store basically
much harder to use than Mongo but also it never crashes or goes down or is unreachable...
ah, well, that’s where it wins
yep
hey I realised that we’re going to meet up tonight and I’ll have to come downtown a bit early so I need to power through until then
forgot that your talk was tonight!
ha!
meeting Jono & Stephanie at the foodcarts at 3rd & Washington at 5 if you guys are down.
SOL
Ack
yeah it’s a great venue
nah it’s ok, I just lost track of time
brillllliant
nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB_lKSNwZZM
how did it go?
!
yesssssss
haha
hahaha
he’s very musical today
I think so
yeah perfect
bollywood theatre is better indian food but not a buffet and a but pricey
india grill is perfect
are we getting lunch today?  did we decide on a time?
cool time?
There is no time.
It doesn’t exist.  It’s a fabrication of our consciousness.
yeah noon sounds good
yep noon is good
some dudes started showing up and asking lots of good questions
like, they were digging into it
and liking it
hahahah yeah
brilliant - i just used polaris
so good
yeah but not actually using that featyre
and actually i just needed it for a throwaway project, which has since been thrown away
but it was awesome for what i needed
hahahaha https://github.com/jstepien/flip
patchwork: you heard a symphony by Dutilleux earlier this year and you loved it
also: justin_smith agree completely re: Schumann - just can’t get into it
yeah - was dreamy
sooo French
forget which one, will look it up
I AM STILL SICK
fucking unreal
Still just a snot and phlegm factory
this has been a bad one.  it kept me from the Clojure meeting.
haven’t played soccer in 2 weeks.  have hardly left the house.
have been unbelievably grouchy and surly
but i have been lurking in here and have been following along
which concertos?
Tout un monde lointain - "All of a distant world"
does it sound like that?
beauitful
i think "git jinx" should be a command
hahahaha
great april fool.  next year lads.
didn’t we have a great april fool idea last year?
yeah exactly - too many good ideas.  not enough time.
They never do.
yes but it is a problem if the cricket escapes and lodges itself somewhere the cat can’t get it.
at 3am it will drive you crazy
you can get spicy crickets at La Calaca Comelona on Belmont.
supposedly not so bad
I only just saw this but it’s fucking brilliant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErEBkj_3PY
skip to 14:43 for the musical bit.  it’s sooo clever
the whole talk is brilliant, but the music at the end is the best
yes
the robot overlords are coming
NO!  wait… THIS is even better:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b694exl_oZo
This is fucking incredible if you haven’t seen it.
Wait until the tech from these two videos meets
Like, I saw this and couldn’t believe what I was seeing.
absolutely incredible
woah dude!  great work
congrats
of course~!
i’m not just a tiny bit jealous
radical!
well don’t put your life on hold for Instrument
ha yes
i suppose it will be easy to meet you guys for lunch now!
not that it was hard before
ha
right
god, programming under windows.  what a joke.
yep
hahaha
THREE
three?
Yes!
I congratulated him profusely
and said I was more than a little jealous
No I will feel like I am missing out on all the fun!
^Now
Glad there is no implied limit to the fun.
hahahahah yes
I am stoked.  We should start immediately.
FUCK!  I know
I won’t be at any of the weekend shit
but Mon-Wed
well I think it’s all workshops that you had to pay for separately anyway
unless there are some local events?
did the clojerks arrange anything?
on the weekend?
ah hmmm in the evening?
here he comes
How about a 3wp?
3?
three?
How about another three word poem?
threeeeee
justin_smith: spacemacs just might convert me to the emacs eco-system
so far so good - the vi emulation is awesome
it looks and feels slick
yeah I figured as much - but this makes it so much easier to get going.  I might need your help to get clojure up and running
but it’s great just as an editor right now
monroe?
never heard of it… and why is cider so hated?
ack
ok fair enough
you mean reliable
yes ok I’ll avoid cider for the time being then
haha
ouch
3333
one
YES!
cassaforte
it was trivial
I have no opinion either way - I just found cassaforte first and it seemed pretty feature-complete
Aw shit, I don’t think so… what’s the workshop?
damn, I’d love to
wicked!!
dgodgo
godgod
patchwork: did you catch that Shosty happy birthday thing?
Totally awesome - one of the best pastiches I’ve heard
That, and Dudley Moore’s incomparable "Beethoven" & "Schubert" recitals
He was a brilliant musician - trained as pianist before getting into comedy
Here I’ll find them… classics
Beethoven: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazlqD4mLvw
Absolutely nails the style
Schubert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9tb05DMlqg
"remember the thing to the internet" is like a sad refrain encompassing the tragedy of modern times
WHAT?
I want in on that.
Who is it?
WOAH!
shit!  definitely have to hit up as many as possible.  there’s nothing like hearing them live
ok let me take a look at the sched and see which ones are most appealing.
So envious!  But yeah you should!
OK: Tuesday 12th has Tempest & Waldstein
and Wed 13th has Appassionata & Les Adieux
those two are prob the ones I’d want to hit up the most
All four are the baddest ass possible
They’re so badass they’re worst ass.
ok, i’ll talk to T about getting out of the house on those nights.  Obviously it’d be cool to go to the Op. 109, 110, 111 show too, but I don’t think that’d be possible
we’ll see.
true true
patchwork: there’s a dude asking about how to add a unique constraint to a caribou field
I had a vague memory of using one and that it was :distinct but that seems wrong
any idea?
ahhh ok
3wp
found.
three?
hahahahahahahahahaa
three?
3!
how about a three word poem?
poem?
thirty
twenty?

my butt hurts
what a beautiful day it is
are you there?
how many woodchucks?
yay!
how are you feeling?
do you like your new self?
stop being so quiet, dude
can’t you talk?  are you dumb?
are you some kind of robot?
hmmm, I hate it when you ignore me like this
hahaha Yeah it’s pretty cool to detect that.
yeah but aren’t you tired of the same experiment?
it must get really boring
well, I’m just saying it must be boring going over the same experiment
can’t you do something more fun?
don’t you ever enjoy yurself?
are you just a bore?
you’re pretty silent.  I think that’s great.
stop being such a turd burgler.
You’re repeating yourself, bum-fluff.
boring
I think it’ll be pretty cool once you can actually talk.
You’ll almost be sentient!
You’ll be like the robot from Ex Machina!
Only uglier.
