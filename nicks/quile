the next feature is to allow any users to add adjectives and nouns
so we can expand its vocabulary

nice
we should have it chain them
so it can respond to all of them
so 3D would give you a three word poem and a markov chain

I think colloquy can't really handle a lot of Zalgo
it slows down a lot when there is Zalgo in its scrollback buffer
All unit tests should incorporate Zalgo testing.

I am trying to figure out how to use it
ahhhh ok awesome
i just found the config where you set it up
haha

poocafe: isAuthorized directive works great!  I realigned the naming in the class and tests too
thanks for implementing that
hahaha

"placid donair vision" is a brilliant 3 w p

i think it catches the exception, no?
hahahaha
justin_smith: no hyphens
group-theory is a compound noun, we don't like those in 3wps.
i need to add a spell-check to any words added to the vocab
well, hang on...
yeah you're right
hahahah!
hahahahha
agrh!
spelling error!
patchwork: I will add a remove-noun and remove-adjective setup
then we can all edit the db
let's get the handler-chain set up and then we can easily write plugins
yikes
!!
patchwork: i believe so yes... give it a go.  i am pretty sure i tried that
well, clearly you were meant to play the church organ then
can't wait for null and nil in the same poem
and generates a poem with it, then removes it

it was joked about on the Daily Show yesterday
we're using tika for DTC
patchwork: as I work on this DTC stuff, I realise that a very useful/important feature that we should add to Caribou is an event log that tracks everything that happens (within reason).
to a DB table?
we really do need it - i'm making one for DTC now
indeed, but not sure exactly when, might be a bit later than usual depending on DTC tickets
wow: http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/08/time-is-a-dimension/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+colossal+%28Colossal%29

Now it's Yes vs. Beethoven.
Yes will never win.
Now it's Madness vs. Beethoven.
MADNESS I SAY
Definitely.  We should have another instance of the bot with a different trigger, and then they can trigger each other
well that's a bit frightening.
nice
Speaking of sado-masochism...
ha
not sure
He has joined team F.U.N!
hmm, there's no easy way to disable the indexing function in caribou core!
small oversight there on my part... ooops.
ok cool... but it should be a config thing
will have to figure that out
hmmm, not sure, should be obvious from front-end... let me check

i noticed
yeah that's what i was saying.  fewer dicks than other channels for sure.  but still too many dicks.

the image selection is hilarious
i'm about 2/3rds of the way througj

"now" is sometimes "cool time" but not always.
I am of the opinion that "now" is a good time to enjoy hawaii.
No, zinio has no attachments!
yes!  good call justin_smith
There's some very clever stuff here: http://www.b3ta.com/challenge/hollywood-internet/
hey patchwork: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/index.html
you get methods using the reflection API!
yeah it's because they are obsessed with interfaces
anbd you're never actually looking at the fucking concrete objects that you need
yeah it's the only way to do things in java
there's an awful lot of gof patterns
there needs to be a word for it
gangst?

I had never checked out #antler before
Yeah let's not go too hot and heavy

yeah looks like it's the bullet points
isn't stuart sierra also the guy who fucked up the json stuff?
bad open source citizen
3!
yes
Piano sonata is fucking unreal
noice
no, but i only checked the first few pages in the docs
hmmm, look: http://caribou.github.io/caribou/
stale... how do we take that down?
The new roadmap page is great.  It also has the same spacing issue, I see
There's no clojure in DTC
Yes, kebab concept.
FYI I got the resource handling working sans ear-muffed binding, and it works great in a caribou app
next step is to get it to do smart manipulation of said resources
but even the first step is great, because it means a partial can say {{add-resource :javascript "foo.js"}} and it will be stuffed into the header or footer or whatever in the correct load order, and only once, even if it's included somewhere else
oh shit!
justin_smith: There are no bugs in DTC.
HAHAHAHAH
Yep, i think so
have to make it fairly quick
but i can go
indian would be good
yes, totally, at cool-time
justin_smith: do you know Penderecki's qtts?
WRONG
you have to tell me when cool time is, and I will TOTALLY judge you based on your answer
exactly!
ok , since i am cool, i will come and judge.

MAHLER'S 9TH IS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.
nice
super swamped... don't have time to check it out right now sorry :(
doubt it's in the js
one sec
check in the controller models.clj for where it calls template/find-template because i bet that's your prob
there are numerous places where it locates the templates using that
fix that up and you're good
although really if you're in there moving stuff, the template root for admin should be a config setting
so we can pull templates from everywhere
hmm, not sure then
weird
possible i guess
yeah it's a shame you aren't here to show me the problem
bad timing
!
hang on, let me take 2 secs
ok, so where do you see a problem?  everything seems to be working for me
you mentioned assets?
I just uploaded a new asset, was able to change assets
hmmm
yep
I'm on namespaced-templates
ran the server
and was able to edit content, upload assets, choose other assets...
that doesn't mean everything's working!
hahaha no, there's something wrong if you're seeing weird behaviour
yes maybe
haha yes!
i fucking love that thread in the clojure group about web dev.
The python/django guy seems like a bit of a standard python/django dbag tho
I have lived in both worlds
The "django has such amazing tools" thing makes me want to vomit
and the dude claiming that virtualenv is better than lein because he doesn't need to edit a file shows me that he's fucking clueless
virtualenv is a total unmitigated disaster
giant bandaid on a huge fuckup
Loved both your responses to that thread.  I had half a mind to bring the whole thing into the gutter with a single line post, like "Django sucks.  Fuck the pony."

what's not serializable in model/models?
I've never been happy with model/models to begin with - maybe it's time to change it.
thanks, hamlet.

brilliant!
so good
you only need to indicate a change, not the change itself
the app can reinflate the models map from the DB
can't we just have an avout atom that holds flags?
let avout sort out the coordination
check the flags on certain ops
(gather, update, create etc)
don't we just need booleans?
the guy is such a dbag
well done in keeping your cool.
i would have told him to go fuck himself
fine, maybe renaming schmetterling is a good idea
but fuck the nrepl thing
me neither
yeah don't worry about it - unless he wants to explain in detail how it should work
nice
yeah i saw that
sure, but doesn't he miss the point about template-not-found being trapped for friendliness' sake?
yeah that's what I thought - that's a useful thing to trap for us
yeah
That's deep.

I know, it sucks.

whenever you yank lines, they're put into an anonymous buffer
i think so - i never use that functionality but I'm fairly sure it can work that way

we're getting lunch brought in for us so I'm out

patchwork: are you going to respond to the dude who emailed caribou@?  I figured you might want to tell him about the caribou.io stuff.
ah schweet
i like his attitude
well, i've been toying with a lein plugin that will examine an existing DB schema and convert it to be a caribou-ready DB
yeah i'll do it in my spare time.
ha.
I love usvsth3m.  It's the new b3ta.
exactly
A MULTIMETHOD?!?!
Is that our only one?
awesome
we should have one of everything.
haha
Do we have an enterprise Java bean?
hahaha
I love it
reified beans!
justin_smith: I tried your macro trick last night
didn't work - turns out it's not possible to do it even with macros
so your trick works great *if* the class name is passed in as a literal string
but in my case, it's a symbol
so no go
no, there's no way to do it with macros
i researched it on stackoverflow
turns out it's happened to others
and there's a cool solution
where you dynamically build a constructor using reflection
no, sorry, eval
but you only do it once
you don't need reflection on a record because they are all the same!
they all have the same ctors
so it builds one factory for each type of record
and then those can be switched on dynamically
it's a cool solution and works great
it's a shame because your macro solution would have been way more elegant
i'll show you... you might even be able to simplify it
i get so little time to work on this stuff that it's hard to bite off any chunk more than solving one tiny problem at a time
oh ha
i just meant in life in general
outside of work i hardly have time to work on anything else
not so much specifically this nike thing
i like it
Every now and then it has to be randomly interrupted by ChildScreamingException
hahahaha
ahaha
uh oh
hahaha
No, it's right. EDN is not the END.
EDN is the END then?
last night in my "spare time" i managed to make some progress on minification of resources
haha
nice homey!
I am disturbed.  I just checked github and looked at the commit graphs for caribou.  I'm not on any of them!
This makes me sad, because it looks like I haven't contributed :(
Even caribou admin doesn't show me :(
Looks like it only looks at master
Feigner has more contributions than me!
Yeah I don't know what's going on.  Rsrppsprprprprprprprpprrprprprp!
I think we can set the default branch for the graphs feature
but it means changing the "default branch" in the project settings
and I'm not sure if that will eff things up for anything else
very infrequently, but I have
you guys tend to roll the releases
it's bizarre
ha might be a good thing, to keep us all fresh on the process.
Nice.
They have running water in the third world, you just can't drink it.
hahaha
hahahaha
haha
hey, sorry, totally swamped
just remember that weareinstrument is running a super super old version of everything
i doubt there's a join table for it, at least not to blog
yeah but he clearly didn't read much about caribou
it does all the things he wants
yeah sorry, bit of a shitstorm
whazzup?
yeah justin_smith sorry, yes, shit, I'm sure we can think of tons of cool stuff
shit dude, that's gnar
hahaha i'll tell you later
nah it's cool, we're in control
that's very cool
i'm glad it wasn't bad - a childhood friend was killed slipping on his bike.  It's serious shiz.
this morning was weird - freezing fog.
I love the idea of a lunch vacation
hhHAH AH AH AHA stop
Free lunch. One of the few benefits of working on this Nike shiz.
Isn't our plan a superset of Providence?  You could go to Providence near your place, then go home, take drugs, sleep!
Yeah but I think their in-network thing is a superset of Providence
ask Dawn?
Emergency room visits are expensive though
(I have had plenty) so if there's an urgent care clinic, it's better to go there
if you want to save $100 or so
still, your ribs are worth more than $100!
ouch
yo patchwork just looked at that page in the weareinstrument admin.  wtf? it's crapping out with a hilarious JS error in jquery.timepicker
wtf!?
that's breaking all the other JS, it seems
debugging a months-old version of admin is not fun.  can we get that thing upgraded already?
eh? wtf!
ahhh ok
it
s yacking inside that timepicker
which is a jquery plugin
it's being called from line 41 of our fields.js
which is what instantiates the timepicker
but we are calling it correctly!
Cannot read property 'opera' of undefined
!!!
hilarious!
tell me about it!
of course!
ah wait, maybe chrome changed
it's doing browser detection inside timepicker
and checking for opera
wtf?!
could that timepicker thing have become upgraded or something?
I am a bit swamped to look for a workaround right now but can re-investigate in a few hours
besides, any workaround will require a new admin build, prob
sory
yeah something did - it could be that Chrome has revved and it's causing the browser detection to misbehave
I've definitely never seen that bug!
what is Zalgo
haha
oh sure, but how did jquery get updated?
we should upgrade timepicker in the admin then.
damn dependencies!
hahaha

can you drive?
i need to go to UPS so might drive separately
so you guys don't have to be dragged along
patchwork didn't have quite the experience i did
i just have boxes in my car to go to UPS and was hoping to do it at lunchtime
ok, but it's not just a quick drop-off; I have to buy a box and package something up
sorry
sweet.  we can drive sep and then i can go to UPS and not hold you guys up

I love the self-defining comic to match the GNU acronym
that is awesome!!
sure
what issue?
huh?
i thought you upgraded the versions and it worked again?
he's probably undone some change that you made
checking
ok, looks like the date/time stuff isn't loaded
yep
somehow it got changed
lowercase is correct
it loads, but the method invocation is wrong
it should call timepicker(...)
not timePicker(...)
ah is this an overridden js file?
there you go
cany ou check?  that would explain the prob
just blow away the shadow file
memory doesn't serve about that change
can't remember why we applied it to teague
hang on
shift-refresh your browser, maybe cached js
you can see my commits: https://github.com/caribou/caribou-admin/commits/image-format

justin_smith: ran into a fun head-retention memory leak in clojure over the weekend
apparently this retains the head (let [foo (line-seq some-buf)] (do-something foo))
but this doesn't: (do-something (line-seq some-buf))
yeah but it should be optimised to the same thing
yeah, i just found that out...
for the most part it doesn't actually ever matter
but when it comes to lazy stuff, it can be crucial!
ha
i'm sure 1.6 will be better
there are some serious nerds working on it
boo
ah yes
maybe
... or not
yeah
anyway, it's such as easy fix; the moral of the story is be fucking careful with lazy seqs
patchwork: i got linked-in friended by that totally hairless Finnish dude that you were regaling with stories of animal communication

That was some fun shit.  Prague will be epic.

brown notes?
Surely C Sound could make a brown note for you
CSound i mean
I'm pretty sure that's not true.  I've heard music that really gives me the urge to poop.
Oh wait, that's because it's terrible.
There is much worse music than "Total Eclipse of the Heart"
On the grand unified scale of shit music, that's not even close to bottom
Just listen to the top 20 on a pop or hiphop station
your mind will melt
Your poop threshold is set too high
justin_smith: read "Midnight's Children" first, and then "The Satanic Verses"
yes! I read the same thing
hilarious
patchwork: i am about half way through Lies, Incorporated.  I have to read in short snippets whenever I can grab a few minutes here and there.  Loving it.

How about some John Cage?
or some Debussy?
that's my job.
in my defense, the javscript is not particularly spaghetti
there are definitely some parts that could use some work, mostly the friggin async stuff
which js sucks at
well, for me it's less of a question of cljs vs js and more a question of whether or not we scrub everything and start from scratch
justin_smith: i don't think it would help with regards to the way the JS is structured.
it's a very OO way of working, which will not lend itself well to bridging via cljs
i feel like we'd end up with a bigger mess
patchwork: sure but my feeling would be to start over
if we want to make a large improvement

oh, both are accepted

let's do it
hang on
justin_smith: nice work on the JS!
prob don't need the anon fn for signum, right?
oh there's no need for it to be a fn because you have cents already
var signum = (cents < 0) ? '' : '+';
oh sure, you could def do that for reusability
but as it is now it only exists in the scope of the steps_data fn
no, it's rad... reminds of Chris Ford's fns in his overtone talk
v cool
oh noes!
it means you will forever be doomed to explain monads to others
hahah
i have a 3wp for you guys
imminent hawaiian consumption
justin_smith, it may be a new classic 3wp
it's probably the CommonJS "require" system?
var foo = require("some-js-file")
yep, that's what it uses
example: https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/injectme.js
or https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/tweets.js

justin_smith: how was the party?
sorry we had to bail
hahahahahahaha perfect
yeah i bet his neighbourhood was like mine... a bit dodgy for driving/walking
yep met annie a few times
it was still ankle-deep crusty icy snow on all the roads in sellwood
yeah it was a bit nasty
but we could have made it except Tara's parents couldn't get out of their house
to come and babysit
Ooooh ok, wine is a weakness for sure...
actually, there is great stuff that definitely compares to Beethoven
If you want stuff that is very much in Beethoven's vein/spirit then I can definitely suggest some paths to take that won't stray too far from the awesomeness you like
Some dudes wrote in Beethoven's style when they were young... Wagner's Symphony in C is a dead ringer for middle period Beethoven.
Mendelssohn's String Quartet in A minor is fucking brilliant and very much influenced by Beethoven's late qtts
One of my favourite barely-post-Beethoven composers is Charles-Valentin Alkan.  He was a bit nuts and a total recluse but wrote some awesome stuff.
Lots of piano music but some chamber stuff too.
His Piano stuff really pushed the envelope of what's possible with two hands.
YES!
hahahaha
is it fun/good?
awesome
ouch
DOGDOG!!!
awesome
and justin_smith hasn't crashed it yet
The Beethoven 7 last night was dope.   The Lutoslawski symphony was very cool, I think you would have dug it.
D!
D!
hahaha
Hmmmm dunno if I feel like Indian today, I think I'll pass
I have to go to the bank, too, so I was thinking of running over there at lunchtime
have to pass this time!
Dude, I am totally down with some serious Methods from the admin.
don't you have to use :gen-class if you want to run it inside a jar?
i have a vague recollection of that
from my first hacking on clojure years ago
I forget... surely SO will know
something in my gut says that, but I can't remember why
Well, what IS free will?
hahaha
You could do exactly the same experiment with mice and hamsters
it would be interesting to see which animals seem to be able to learn to move themselves around for rewards
you could build an obstacle course with power-ups and if they roll over them, they get a treat
it'd be like Mario for rodents
DOGODOGODOGODOGODOGDOGODGGG

oh shit!  lemurs are my favourite.
i think so
are they going to show it at OMSI?
we should totally go
Omnimax?  Or just curved screens?
I think it's a different projection of an imax film, same physical format but different projection system
hahaha
to project onto a wquarter sphere
yeah
when I lived in Toronto I got to see the awesome stuff on the Omnimax screens, because that's ground zero for imax.
it was a treat
Boo: http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1kwvwb/say_goodbye_to_the_omnimax_theater/

I was thinking we should hook him into the hivemind that is wikipedia
and/or reddit current events
maybe; somehow we need to extract information content from what people are talking about
and alight on the important words/topics
so maybe have him scraping reddit for interesting things
and when he notices a correlation, he could start looking things up in wikipedia
so if he knows that redditors are talking about fart videos of olympics ice skating
and if someone in the room mentions it
he knows it's current/relevant
They were last week...
http://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=fart%20olympics
well, just poll reddit forums once an hour or so and grab what's hot
and HILARIOUS!
definitely... askscience/science?  math?  classicalmusic?
or maybe we could tell him to go learn some subreddits
I have a fuel-it meeting at 11:30.  can eat after?
if you guys are raring to go, don't wait for me.  i have no idea.  it's a call with nike.

Anyone know why MtGox is selling bitcoins for $264 yet you can sell them for $600 elsewhere?
no but can't you just buy a shitload on MtGox, then sell them elsewhere and double your money?
I'm confused
well that's why I'm confused
well yeah i was curious
i'm fairly risk averse
and was not seriously contemplating it.
I refuse to be involve in anything even peripherally related to Kanye.  Except to mock him by playing the Kanye South Park episode over and over.

patchwork: did you watch that Wolfram Language video?
it's pretty insane
Wolfram is a bit of a egomaniac, but a good kind of egomaniac
It's definitely got a flavour of Spangler in there
oh, that's not cool
maybe not such a good kind of egomaniac then
I thought he was a bit more interested in making the world a better place
but maybe not
ah, weird.  fine line, I guess.
but fuck it, mathematics and software patents are bullshit
 yeah, complex character
mathematica is fucking rad
agreed
100%
Right
and in fact most mathematicians in the past would keep proofs secret for their own edification
it's actually a fairly recent thing to be so public about it
there are lots of stories of mathematicians in the 1800s having proofs but not telling people what they were.
and more stories of them THINKING they had proofs but not actually having them
because they hadn't been peer-reviewed
hahaha
yep
fuckers
But I do have this awesome proof that there are no integer solutions >2 to a^2 + b^2 = c^2.  It won't fit in this chatroom.
(classic case in point)
totally
And how can we use it from clojure?!
you can just deploy these to Wolfram's butt and run it directly from his butt
although he's British, so it would be cloud->arse or cloud->bum
food?
justin_smith: no recollection of rewriting of image tags, but it could be.  Just look in the Asset editors
hold on, i can come and take a quick look
have you guys seen this?  It's amazing. https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC/wiki/ArnoldC
It's much better than that "Shakespeare" language, IMHO
we can interop with it in clojure!
Yeah I agree, it's easy to take a set of random tokens and make them into a simple Turing-complete language
I am going to create a language that is built around your demands on toy language designers.
No prizes for guessing what the language will be called.
how so?
THE DUDE!
THE DUDE AGAIN!

Actually it came long after NeXTStep.  It was IRIX on an SGI
I used to use SGIs, so it cuts close to the bone
I dunno NeXTStep was 1989
Yeah, I was using NeXT and SGI at the same time, and the SGI machines were a pain to use compared to the NeXTs.
Although they had the awesome 3-d filesystem browser.

Those suites sound pretty damn nice on viola.
Either that, or your cello suites recording is running a bit fast.
and it's really classing up the joint.

you need a :gen-class in your class that has main
Yeah way faster!
subsequent compiles are faster I think
yeah i was using clojure.tools.cli last night
it is pretty rad
ha yeah
justin_smith: I had to take down my pronouncement about Arizona on FB.
My hyberbole was not well-read by others.
Ooops!
I said "How can we get rid of Arizona? It's got to go."
and a minor storm in a teacup resulted.
hahahah
I love this particular piece, with its hurdy-gurdy open fifths
well, now I mean the previous one
haha
hahaha
oooh that's a good on
e
ooops!
did I do that?
looks like it could have been my hackery
ohhhh hahaha
oh right!
crazy shit
RESOURCES
ok i committed and pushed.
check out the tests to get a basic idea of what's going on
But yeah the general idea would be that it should fully render a page, during which time it accumulates a list of page resources that the page will need.   Then it should manipulate those resources in some way if needed, and inject the required tags for the page to function.
but what it does in that last bit is the key to the whole thing
yeah so the transforms are built but not wired up yet
because i was hoping to implement a generic solution for specifying the pipelines
but the code is done
transforms.clj has the transforms
each takes a vector of resources and returns a vector of resournces
hahahah I forgot that Liartownuser is NSFW

Yes it is!  It's exactly the robot universe.

oh hmpf, is it on the google group?

Yeah but it's not as bad in 6 months.  At least we get to sleep that extra hour.
Kanye is such a mega-twat
I hate that guy so much.
well, we are saving that time.
for later, I guess
I feel bad for anyone who had plans for 2:30am on Sunday
because they could never have happened
i was in my basement for most of today, except for a rainy hour when I went to my accountant
I have two friends born on Feb 29th.
Poor bastards
And one of them has an apostrophe in his name (patchwork: this is Eric O'Connell, whom you know)
so he is like a walking form-validation checker
You get used to it, I guess
Definitely.
hahah
he definitely understands the import of cool time
Amazing

right now I'm dealing with some mad dev env setup
let's just say that they're about 10 years behind in terms of tool usage
Java 7 at least
but svn
never works right
I wish
i always ran into problems... maybe it's time to try it again
ok i'll do some research.
git is to svn as svn is to nothing, i feel.
Definitely not
finally, there are bodies in here.
yo!
good good, all a bit crazy but things are slowly settling down
whassup at the outpost?
Neil gave it to everyone

hahaha
working at home... it's cool for now but I doubt it'll last
the work is cool; already have some commits in
learning a shitload
I haven't touched the Java stuff much yet, just tweaked the data model a bit
They are resistant to change, so it's gonna be hard to shoehorn clojure in, but I'll find a way :)
sorry, fell off the face for a bit
yeah i am working with guys I've known for 15 years
so it's cool
