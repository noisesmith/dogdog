the next feature is to allow any users to add adjectives and nouns
so we can expand its vocabulary

nice
we should have it chain them
so it can respond to all of them
so 3D would give you a three word poem and a markov chain

I think colloquy can't really handle a lot of Zalgo
it slows down a lot when there is Zalgo in its scrollback buffer
All unit tests should incorporate Zalgo testing.

I am trying to figure out how to use it
ahhhh ok awesome
i just found the config where you set it up
haha

poocafe: isAuthorized directive works great!  I realigned the naming in the class and tests too
thanks for implementing that
hahaha

"placid donair vision" is a brilliant 3 w p

i think it catches the exception, no?
hahahaha
justin_smith: no hyphens
group-theory is a compound noun, we don't like those in 3wps.
i need to add a spell-check to any words added to the vocab
well, hang on...
yeah you're right
hahahah!
hahahahha
agrh!
spelling error!
patchwork: I will add a remove-noun and remove-adjective setup
then we can all edit the db
let's get the handler-chain set up and then we can easily write plugins
yikes
!!
patchwork: i believe so yes... give it a go.  i am pretty sure i tried that
well, clearly you were meant to play the church organ then
can't wait for null and nil in the same poem
and generates a poem with it, then removes it

it was joked about on the Daily Show yesterday
we're using tika for DTC
patchwork: as I work on this DTC stuff, I realise that a very useful/important feature that we should add to Caribou is an event log that tracks everything that happens (within reason).
to a DB table?
we really do need it - i'm making one for DTC now
indeed, but not sure exactly when, might be a bit later than usual depending on DTC tickets
wow: http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/08/time-is-a-dimension/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+colossal+%28Colossal%29

Now it's Yes vs. Beethoven.
Yes will never win.
Now it's Madness vs. Beethoven.
MADNESS I SAY
Definitely.  We should have another instance of the bot with a different trigger, and then they can trigger each other
well that's a bit frightening.
nice
Speaking of sado-masochism...
ha
not sure
He has joined team F.U.N!
hmm, there's no easy way to disable the indexing function in caribou core!
small oversight there on my part... ooops.
ok cool... but it should be a config thing
will have to figure that out
hmmm, not sure, should be obvious from front-end... let me check

i noticed
yeah that's what i was saying.  fewer dicks than other channels for sure.  but still too many dicks.

the image selection is hilarious
i'm about 2/3rds of the way througj

"now" is sometimes "cool time" but not always.
I am of the opinion that "now" is a good time to enjoy hawaii.
No, zinio has no attachments!
yes!  good call justin_smith
There's some very clever stuff here: http://www.b3ta.com/challenge/hollywood-internet/
hey patchwork: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/index.html
you get methods using the reflection API!
yeah it's because they are obsessed with interfaces
anbd you're never actually looking at the fucking concrete objects that you need
yeah it's the only way to do things in java
there's an awful lot of gof patterns
there needs to be a word for it
gangst?

I had never checked out #antler before
Yeah let's not go too hot and heavy

yeah looks like it's the bullet points
isn't stuart sierra also the guy who fucked up the json stuff?
bad open source citizen
3!
yes
Piano sonata is fucking unreal
noice
no, but i only checked the first few pages in the docs
hmmm, look: http://caribou.github.io/caribou/
stale... how do we take that down?
The new roadmap page is great.  It also has the same spacing issue, I see
There's no clojure in DTC
Yes, kebab concept.
FYI I got the resource handling working sans ear-muffed binding, and it works great in a caribou app
next step is to get it to do smart manipulation of said resources
but even the first step is great, because it means a partial can say {{add-resource :javascript "foo.js"}} and it will be stuffed into the header or footer or whatever in the correct load order, and only once, even if it's included somewhere else
oh shit!
justin_smith: There are no bugs in DTC.
HAHAHAHAH
Yep, i think so
have to make it fairly quick
but i can go
indian would be good
yes, totally, at cool-time
justin_smith: do you know Penderecki's qtts?
WRONG
you have to tell me when cool time is, and I will TOTALLY judge you based on your answer
exactly!
ok , since i am cool, i will come and judge.

MAHLER'S 9TH IS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.
nice
super swamped... don't have time to check it out right now sorry :(
doubt it's in the js
one sec
check in the controller models.clj for where it calls template/find-template because i bet that's your prob
there are numerous places where it locates the templates using that
fix that up and you're good
although really if you're in there moving stuff, the template root for admin should be a config setting
so we can pull templates from everywhere
hmm, not sure then
weird
possible i guess
yeah it's a shame you aren't here to show me the problem
bad timing
!
hang on, let me take 2 secs
ok, so where do you see a problem?  everything seems to be working for me
you mentioned assets?
I just uploaded a new asset, was able to change assets
hmmm
yep
I'm on namespaced-templates
ran the server
and was able to edit content, upload assets, choose other assets...
that doesn't mean everything's working!
hahaha no, there's something wrong if you're seeing weird behaviour
yes maybe
haha yes!
i fucking love that thread in the clojure group about web dev.
The python/django guy seems like a bit of a standard python/django dbag tho
I have lived in both worlds
The "django has such amazing tools" thing makes me want to vomit
and the dude claiming that virtualenv is better than lein because he doesn't need to edit a file shows me that he's fucking clueless
virtualenv is a total unmitigated disaster
giant bandaid on a huge fuckup
Loved both your responses to that thread.  I had half a mind to bring the whole thing into the gutter with a single line post, like "Django sucks.  Fuck the pony."

what's not serializable in model/models?
I've never been happy with model/models to begin with - maybe it's time to change it.
thanks, hamlet.

brilliant!
so good
you only need to indicate a change, not the change itself
the app can reinflate the models map from the DB
can't we just have an avout atom that holds flags?
let avout sort out the coordination
check the flags on certain ops
(gather, update, create etc)
don't we just need booleans?
the guy is such a dbag
well done in keeping your cool.
i would have told him to go fuck himself
fine, maybe renaming schmetterling is a good idea
but fuck the nrepl thing
me neither
yeah don't worry about it - unless he wants to explain in detail how it should work
nice
yeah i saw that
sure, but doesn't he miss the point about template-not-found being trapped for friendliness' sake?
yeah that's what I thought - that's a useful thing to trap for us
yeah
That's deep.

I know, it sucks.

whenever you yank lines, they're put into an anonymous buffer
i think so - i never use that functionality but I'm fairly sure it can work that way

we're getting lunch brought in for us so I'm out

patchwork: are you going to respond to the dude who emailed caribou@?  I figured you might want to tell him about the caribou.io stuff.
ah schweet
i like his attitude
well, i've been toying with a lein plugin that will examine an existing DB schema and convert it to be a caribou-ready DB
yeah i'll do it in my spare time.
ha.
I love usvsth3m.  It's the new b3ta.
exactly
A MULTIMETHOD?!?!
Is that our only one?
awesome
we should have one of everything.
haha
Do we have an enterprise Java bean?
hahaha
I love it
reified beans!
justin_smith: I tried your macro trick last night
didn't work - turns out it's not possible to do it even with macros
so your trick works great *if* the class name is passed in as a literal string
but in my case, it's a symbol
so no go
no, there's no way to do it with macros
i researched it on stackoverflow
turns out it's happened to others
and there's a cool solution
where you dynamically build a constructor using reflection
no, sorry, eval
but you only do it once
you don't need reflection on a record because they are all the same!
they all have the same ctors
so it builds one factory for each type of record
and then those can be switched on dynamically
it's a cool solution and works great
it's a shame because your macro solution would have been way more elegant
i'll show you... you might even be able to simplify it
i get so little time to work on this stuff that it's hard to bite off any chunk more than solving one tiny problem at a time
oh ha
i just meant in life in general
outside of work i hardly have time to work on anything else
not so much specifically this nike thing
i like it
Every now and then it has to be randomly interrupted by ChildScreamingException
hahahaha
ahaha
uh oh
hahaha
No, it's right. EDN is not the END.
EDN is the END then?
last night in my "spare time" i managed to make some progress on minification of resources
haha
nice homey!
I am disturbed.  I just checked github and looked at the commit graphs for caribou.  I'm not on any of them!
This makes me sad, because it looks like I haven't contributed :(
Even caribou admin doesn't show me :(
Looks like it only looks at master
Feigner has more contributions than me!
Yeah I don't know what's going on.  Rsrppsprprprprprprprpprrprprprp!
I think we can set the default branch for the graphs feature
but it means changing the "default branch" in the project settings
and I'm not sure if that will eff things up for anything else
very infrequently, but I have
you guys tend to roll the releases
it's bizarre
ha might be a good thing, to keep us all fresh on the process.
Nice.
They have running water in the third world, you just can't drink it.

hey, sorry, totally swamped
just remember that weareinstrument is running a super super old version of everything
i doubt there's a join table for it, at least not to blog
yeah but he clearly didn't read much about caribou
it does all the things he wants
yeah sorry, bit of a shitstorm
whazzup?
yeah justin_smith sorry, yes, shit, I'm sure we can think of tons of cool stuff
shit dude, that's gnar
hahaha i'll tell you later
nah it's cool, we're in control
that's very cool
i'm glad it wasn't bad - a childhood friend was killed slipping on his bike.  It's serious shiz.
this morning was weird - freezing fog.
I love the idea of a lunch vacation
hhHAH AH AH AHA stop
Free lunch. One of the few benefits of working on this Nike shiz.
Isn't our plan a superset of Providence?  You could go to Providence near your place, then go home, take drugs, sleep!
Yeah but I think their in-network thing is a superset of Providence
ask Dawn?
Emergency room visits are expensive though
(I have had plenty) so if there's an urgent care clinic, it's better to go there
if you want to save $100 or so
still, your ribs are worth more than $100!
ouch
yo patchwork just looked at that page in the weareinstrument admin.  wtf? it's crapping out with a hilarious JS error in jquery.timepicker
wtf!?
that's breaking all the other JS, it seems
debugging a months-old version of admin is not fun.  can we get that thing upgraded already?
eh? wtf!
ahhh ok
it
s yacking inside that timepicker
which is a jquery plugin
it's being called from line 41 of our fields.js
which is what instantiates the timepicker
but we are calling it correctly!
Cannot read property 'opera' of undefined
!!!
hilarious!
tell me about it!
of course!
ah wait, maybe chrome changed
it's doing browser detection inside timepicker
and checking for opera
wtf?!
could that timepicker thing have become upgraded or something?
I am a bit swamped to look for a workaround right now but can re-investigate in a few hours
besides, any workaround will require a new admin build, prob
sory
yeah something did - it could be that Chrome has revved and it's causing the browser detection to misbehave
I've definitely never seen that bug!
what is Zalgo
haha
oh sure, but how did jquery get updated?
we should upgrade timepicker in the admin then.
damn dependencies!
hahaha
