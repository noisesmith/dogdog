the next feature is to allow any users to add adjectives and nouns
so we can expand its vocabulary

nice
we should have it chain them
so it can respond to all of them
so 3D would give you a three word poem and a markov chain

I think colloquy can't really handle a lot of Zalgo
it slows down a lot when there is Zalgo in its scrollback buffer
All unit tests should incorporate Zalgo testing.

I am trying to figure out how to use it
ahhhh ok awesome
i just found the config where you set it up
haha

poocafe: isAuthorized directive works great!  I realigned the naming in the class and tests too
thanks for implementing that
hahaha

"placid donair vision" is a brilliant 3 w p

i think it catches the exception, no?
hahahaha
justin_smith: no hyphens
group-theory is a compound noun, we don't like those in 3wps.
i need to add a spell-check to any words added to the vocab
well, hang on...
yeah you're right
hahahah!
hahahahha
agrh!
spelling error!
patchwork: I will add a remove-noun and remove-adjective setup
then we can all edit the db
let's get the handler-chain set up and then we can easily write plugins
yikes
!!
patchwork: i believe so yes... give it a go.  i am pretty sure i tried that
well, clearly you were meant to play the church organ then
can't wait for null and nil in the same poem
and generates a poem with it, then removes it

it was joked about on the Daily Show yesterday
we're using tika for DTC
patchwork: as I work on this DTC stuff, I realise that a very useful/important feature that we should add to Caribou is an event log that tracks everything that happens (within reason).
to a DB table?
we really do need it - i'm making one for DTC now
indeed, but not sure exactly when, might be a bit later than usual depending on DTC tickets
wow: http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/08/time-is-a-dimension/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+colossal+%28Colossal%29

Now it's Yes vs. Beethoven.
Yes will never win.
Now it's Madness vs. Beethoven.
MADNESS I SAY
Definitely.  We should have another instance of the bot with a different trigger, and then they can trigger each other
well that's a bit frightening.
nice
Speaking of sado-masochism...
ha
not sure
He has joined team F.U.N!
hmm, there's no easy way to disable the indexing function in caribou core!
small oversight there on my part... ooops.
ok cool... but it should be a config thing
will have to figure that out
hmmm, not sure, should be obvious from front-end... let me check

i noticed
yeah that's what i was saying.  fewer dicks than other channels for sure.  but still too many dicks.

the image selection is hilarious
i'm about 2/3rds of the way througj

"now" is sometimes "cool time" but not always.
I am of the opinion that "now" is a good time to enjoy hawaii.
No, zinio has no attachments!
yes!  good call justin_smith
There's some very clever stuff here: http://www.b3ta.com/challenge/hollywood-internet/
hey patchwork: http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java-reflection/index.html
you get methods using the reflection API!
yeah it's because they are obsessed with interfaces
anbd you're never actually looking at the fucking concrete objects that you need
yeah it's the only way to do things in java
there's an awful lot of gof patterns
there needs to be a word for it
gangst?

I had never checked out #antler before
Yeah let's not go too hot and heavy

yeah looks like it's the bullet points
isn't stuart sierra also the guy who fucked up the json stuff?
bad open source citizen
3!
yes
Piano sonata is fucking unreal
noice
no, but i only checked the first few pages in the docs
hmmm, look: http://caribou.github.io/caribou/
stale... how do we take that down?
The new roadmap page is great.  It also has the same spacing issue, I see
There's no clojure in DTC
Yes, kebab concept.
FYI I got the resource handling working sans ear-muffed binding, and it works great in a caribou app
next step is to get it to do smart manipulation of said resources
but even the first step is great, because it means a partial can say {{add-resource :javascript "foo.js"}} and it will be stuffed into the header or footer or whatever in the correct load order, and only once, even if it's included somewhere else
oh shit!
justin_smith: There are no bugs in DTC.
HAHAHAHAH
Yep, i think so
have to make it fairly quick
but i can go
indian would be good
yes, totally, at cool-time
justin_smith: do you know Penderecki's qtts?
WRONG
you have to tell me when cool time is, and I will TOTALLY judge you based on your answer
exactly!
ok , since i am cool, i will come and judge.

MAHLER'S 9TH IS FUCKING UNBELIEVABLE.
nice
super swamped... don't have time to check it out right now sorry :(
doubt it's in the js
one sec
check in the controller models.clj for where it calls template/find-template because i bet that's your prob
there are numerous places where it locates the templates using that
fix that up and you're good
although really if you're in there moving stuff, the template root for admin should be a config setting
so we can pull templates from everywhere
hmm, not sure then
weird
possible i guess
yeah it's a shame you aren't here to show me the problem
bad timing
!
hang on, let me take 2 secs
ok, so where do you see a problem?  everything seems to be working for me
you mentioned assets?
I just uploaded a new asset, was able to change assets
hmmm
yep
I'm on namespaced-templates
ran the server
and was able to edit content, upload assets, choose other assets...
that doesn't mean everything's working!
hahaha no, there's something wrong if you're seeing weird behaviour
yes maybe
haha yes!
i fucking love that thread in the clojure group about web dev.
The python/django guy seems like a bit of a standard python/django dbag tho
I have lived in both worlds
The "django has such amazing tools" thing makes me want to vomit
and the dude claiming that virtualenv is better than lein because he doesn't need to edit a file shows me that he's fucking clueless
virtualenv is a total unmitigated disaster
giant bandaid on a huge fuckup
Loved both your responses to that thread.  I had half a mind to bring the whole thing into the gutter with a single line post, like "Django sucks.  Fuck the pony."

what's not serializable in model/models?
I've never been happy with model/models to begin with - maybe it's time to change it.
thanks, hamlet.

brilliant!
so good
you only need to indicate a change, not the change itself
the app can reinflate the models map from the DB
can't we just have an avout atom that holds flags?
let avout sort out the coordination
check the flags on certain ops
(gather, update, create etc)
don't we just need booleans?
the guy is such a dbag
well done in keeping your cool.
i would have told him to go fuck himself
fine, maybe renaming schmetterling is a good idea
but fuck the nrepl thing
me neither
yeah don't worry about it - unless he wants to explain in detail how it should work
nice
yeah i saw that
sure, but doesn't he miss the point about template-not-found being trapped for friendliness' sake?
yeah that's what I thought - that's a useful thing to trap for us
yeah
That's deep.

I know, it sucks.

whenever you yank lines, they're put into an anonymous buffer
i think so - i never use that functionality but I'm fairly sure it can work that way

we're getting lunch brought in for us so I'm out

patchwork: are you going to respond to the dude who emailed caribou@?  I figured you might want to tell him about the caribou.io stuff.
ah schweet
i like his attitude
well, i've been toying with a lein plugin that will examine an existing DB schema and convert it to be a caribou-ready DB
yeah i'll do it in my spare time.
ha.
I love usvsth3m.  It's the new b3ta.
exactly
A MULTIMETHOD?!?!
Is that our only one?
awesome
we should have one of everything.
haha
Do we have an enterprise Java bean?
hahaha
I love it
reified beans!
justin_smith: I tried your macro trick last night
didn't work - turns out it's not possible to do it even with macros
so your trick works great *if* the class name is passed in as a literal string
but in my case, it's a symbol
so no go
no, there's no way to do it with macros
i researched it on stackoverflow
turns out it's happened to others
and there's a cool solution
where you dynamically build a constructor using reflection
no, sorry, eval
but you only do it once
you don't need reflection on a record because they are all the same!
they all have the same ctors
so it builds one factory for each type of record
and then those can be switched on dynamically
it's a cool solution and works great
it's a shame because your macro solution would have been way more elegant
i'll show you... you might even be able to simplify it
i get so little time to work on this stuff that it's hard to bite off any chunk more than solving one tiny problem at a time
oh ha
i just meant in life in general
outside of work i hardly have time to work on anything else
not so much specifically this nike thing
i like it
Every now and then it has to be randomly interrupted by ChildScreamingException
hahahaha
ahaha
uh oh
hahaha
No, it's right. EDN is not the END.
EDN is the END then?
last night in my "spare time" i managed to make some progress on minification of resources
haha
nice homey!
I am disturbed.  I just checked github and looked at the commit graphs for caribou.  I'm not on any of them!
This makes me sad, because it looks like I haven't contributed :(
Even caribou admin doesn't show me :(
Looks like it only looks at master
Feigner has more contributions than me!
Yeah I don't know what's going on.  Rsrppsprprprprprprprpprrprprprp!
I think we can set the default branch for the graphs feature
but it means changing the "default branch" in the project settings
and I'm not sure if that will eff things up for anything else
very infrequently, but I have
you guys tend to roll the releases
it's bizarre
ha might be a good thing, to keep us all fresh on the process.
Nice.
They have running water in the third world, you just can't drink it.
hahaha
hahahaha
haha
hey, sorry, totally swamped
just remember that weareinstrument is running a super super old version of everything
i doubt there's a join table for it, at least not to blog
yeah but he clearly didn't read much about caribou
it does all the things he wants
yeah sorry, bit of a shitstorm
whazzup?
yeah justin_smith sorry, yes, shit, I'm sure we can think of tons of cool stuff
shit dude, that's gnar
hahaha i'll tell you later
nah it's cool, we're in control
that's very cool
i'm glad it wasn't bad - a childhood friend was killed slipping on his bike.  It's serious shiz.
this morning was weird - freezing fog.
I love the idea of a lunch vacation
hhHAH AH AH AHA stop
Free lunch. One of the few benefits of working on this Nike shiz.
Isn't our plan a superset of Providence?  You could go to Providence near your place, then go home, take drugs, sleep!
Yeah but I think their in-network thing is a superset of Providence
ask Dawn?
Emergency room visits are expensive though
(I have had plenty) so if there's an urgent care clinic, it's better to go there
if you want to save $100 or so
still, your ribs are worth more than $100!
ouch
yo patchwork just looked at that page in the weareinstrument admin.  wtf? it's crapping out with a hilarious JS error in jquery.timepicker
wtf!?
that's breaking all the other JS, it seems
debugging a months-old version of admin is not fun.  can we get that thing upgraded already?
eh? wtf!
ahhh ok
it
s yacking inside that timepicker
which is a jquery plugin
it's being called from line 41 of our fields.js
which is what instantiates the timepicker
but we are calling it correctly!
Cannot read property 'opera' of undefined
!!!
hilarious!
tell me about it!
of course!
ah wait, maybe chrome changed
it's doing browser detection inside timepicker
and checking for opera
wtf?!
could that timepicker thing have become upgraded or something?
I am a bit swamped to look for a workaround right now but can re-investigate in a few hours
besides, any workaround will require a new admin build, prob
sory
yeah something did - it could be that Chrome has revved and it's causing the browser detection to misbehave
I've definitely never seen that bug!
what is Zalgo
haha
oh sure, but how did jquery get updated?
we should upgrade timepicker in the admin then.
damn dependencies!
hahaha

can you drive?
i need to go to UPS so might drive separately
so you guys don't have to be dragged along
patchwork didn't have quite the experience i did
i just have boxes in my car to go to UPS and was hoping to do it at lunchtime
ok, but it's not just a quick drop-off; I have to buy a box and package something up
sorry
sweet.  we can drive sep and then i can go to UPS and not hold you guys up

I love the self-defining comic to match the GNU acronym
that is awesome!!
sure
what issue?
huh?
i thought you upgraded the versions and it worked again?
he's probably undone some change that you made
checking
ok, looks like the date/time stuff isn't loaded
yep
somehow it got changed
lowercase is correct
it loads, but the method invocation is wrong
it should call timepicker(...)
not timePicker(...)
ah is this an overridden js file?
there you go
cany ou check?  that would explain the prob
just blow away the shadow file
memory doesn't serve about that change
can't remember why we applied it to teague
hang on
shift-refresh your browser, maybe cached js
you can see my commits: https://github.com/caribou/caribou-admin/commits/image-format

justin_smith: ran into a fun head-retention memory leak in clojure over the weekend
apparently this retains the head (let [foo (line-seq some-buf)] (do-something foo))
but this doesn't: (do-something (line-seq some-buf))
yeah but it should be optimised to the same thing
yeah, i just found that out...
for the most part it doesn't actually ever matter
but when it comes to lazy stuff, it can be crucial!
ha
i'm sure 1.6 will be better
there are some serious nerds working on it
boo
ah yes
maybe
... or not
yeah
anyway, it's such as easy fix; the moral of the story is be fucking careful with lazy seqs
patchwork: i got linked-in friended by that totally hairless Finnish dude that you were regaling with stories of animal communication

That was some fun shit.  Prague will be epic.

brown notes?
Surely C Sound could make a brown note for you
CSound i mean
I'm pretty sure that's not true.  I've heard music that really gives me the urge to poop.
Oh wait, that's because it's terrible.
There is much worse music than "Total Eclipse of the Heart"
On the grand unified scale of shit music, that's not even close to bottom
Just listen to the top 20 on a pop or hiphop station
your mind will melt
Your poop threshold is set too high
justin_smith: read "Midnight's Children" first, and then "The Satanic Verses"
yes! I read the same thing
hilarious
patchwork: i am about half way through Lies, Incorporated.  I have to read in short snippets whenever I can grab a few minutes here and there.  Loving it.

How about some John Cage?
or some Debussy?
that's my job.
in my defense, the javscript is not particularly spaghetti
there are definitely some parts that could use some work, mostly the friggin async stuff
which js sucks at
well, for me it's less of a question of cljs vs js and more a question of whether or not we scrub everything and start from scratch
justin_smith: i don't think it would help with regards to the way the JS is structured.
it's a very OO way of working, which will not lend itself well to bridging via cljs
i feel like we'd end up with a bigger mess
patchwork: sure but my feeling would be to start over
if we want to make a large improvement

oh, both are accepted

let's do it
hang on
justin_smith: nice work on the JS!
prob don't need the anon fn for signum, right?
oh there's no need for it to be a fn because you have cents already
var signum = (cents < 0) ? '' : '+';
oh sure, you could def do that for reusability
but as it is now it only exists in the scope of the steps_data fn
no, it's rad... reminds of Chris Ford's fns in his overtone talk
v cool
oh noes!
it means you will forever be doomed to explain monads to others
hahah
i have a 3wp for you guys
imminent hawaiian consumption
justin_smith, it may be a new classic 3wp
it's probably the CommonJS "require" system?
var foo = require("some-js-file")
yep, that's what it uses
example: https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/injectme.js
or https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/master/examples/tweets.js

justin_smith: how was the party?
sorry we had to bail
hahahahahahaha perfect
yeah i bet his neighbourhood was like mine... a bit dodgy for driving/walking
yep met annie a few times
it was still ankle-deep crusty icy snow on all the roads in sellwood
yeah it was a bit nasty
but we could have made it except Tara's parents couldn't get out of their house
to come and babysit
Ooooh ok, wine is a weakness for sure...
actually, there is great stuff that definitely compares to Beethoven
If you want stuff that is very much in Beethoven's vein/spirit then I can definitely suggest some paths to take that won't stray too far from the awesomeness you like
Some dudes wrote in Beethoven's style when they were young... Wagner's Symphony in C is a dead ringer for middle period Beethoven.
Mendelssohn's String Quartet in A minor is fucking brilliant and very much influenced by Beethoven's late qtts
One of my favourite barely-post-Beethoven composers is Charles-Valentin Alkan.  He was a bit nuts and a total recluse but wrote some awesome stuff.
Lots of piano music but some chamber stuff too.
His Piano stuff really pushed the envelope of what's possible with two hands.
YES!
hahahaha
is it fun/good?
awesome
ouch
DOGDOG!!!
awesome
and justin_smith hasn't crashed it yet
The Beethoven 7 last night was dope.   The Lutoslawski symphony was very cool, I think you would have dug it.
D!
D!
hahaha
Hmmmm dunno if I feel like Indian today, I think I'll pass
I have to go to the bank, too, so I was thinking of running over there at lunchtime
have to pass this time!
Dude, I am totally down with some serious Methods from the admin.
don't you have to use :gen-class if you want to run it inside a jar?
i have a vague recollection of that
from my first hacking on clojure years ago
I forget... surely SO will know
something in my gut says that, but I can't remember why
Well, what IS free will?
hahaha
You could do exactly the same experiment with mice and hamsters
it would be interesting to see which animals seem to be able to learn to move themselves around for rewards
you could build an obstacle course with power-ups and if they roll over them, they get a treat
it'd be like Mario for rodents
DOGODOGODOGODOGODOGDOGODGGG

oh shit!  lemurs are my favourite.
i think so
are they going to show it at OMSI?
we should totally go
Omnimax?  Or just curved screens?
I think it's a different projection of an imax film, same physical format but different projection system
hahaha
to project onto a wquarter sphere
yeah
when I lived in Toronto I got to see the awesome stuff on the Omnimax screens, because that's ground zero for imax.
it was a treat
Boo: http://www.reddit.com/r/Portland/comments/1kwvwb/say_goodbye_to_the_omnimax_theater/

I was thinking we should hook him into the hivemind that is wikipedia
and/or reddit current events
maybe; somehow we need to extract information content from what people are talking about
and alight on the important words/topics
so maybe have him scraping reddit for interesting things
and when he notices a correlation, he could start looking things up in wikipedia
so if he knows that redditors are talking about fart videos of olympics ice skating
and if someone in the room mentions it
he knows it's current/relevant
They were last week...
http://www.reddit.com/search.json?q=fart%20olympics
well, just poll reddit forums once an hour or so and grab what's hot
and HILARIOUS!
definitely... askscience/science?  math?  classicalmusic?
or maybe we could tell him to go learn some subreddits
I have a fuel-it meeting at 11:30.  can eat after?
if you guys are raring to go, don't wait for me.  i have no idea.  it's a call with nike.

Anyone know why MtGox is selling bitcoins for $264 yet you can sell them for $600 elsewhere?
no but can't you just buy a shitload on MtGox, then sell them elsewhere and double your money?
I'm confused
well that's why I'm confused
well yeah i was curious
i'm fairly risk averse
and was not seriously contemplating it.
I refuse to be involve in anything even peripherally related to Kanye.  Except to mock him by playing the Kanye South Park episode over and over.

patchwork: did you watch that Wolfram Language video?
it's pretty insane
Wolfram is a bit of a egomaniac, but a good kind of egomaniac
It's definitely got a flavour of Spangler in there
oh, that's not cool
maybe not such a good kind of egomaniac then
I thought he was a bit more interested in making the world a better place
but maybe not
ah, weird.  fine line, I guess.
but fuck it, mathematics and software patents are bullshit
 yeah, complex character
mathematica is fucking rad
agreed
100%
Right
and in fact most mathematicians in the past would keep proofs secret for their own edification
it's actually a fairly recent thing to be so public about it
there are lots of stories of mathematicians in the 1800s having proofs but not telling people what they were.
and more stories of them THINKING they had proofs but not actually having them
because they hadn't been peer-reviewed
hahaha
yep
fuckers
But I do have this awesome proof that there are no integer solutions >2 to a^2 + b^2 = c^2.  It won't fit in this chatroom.
(classic case in point)
totally
And how can we use it from clojure?!
you can just deploy these to Wolfram's butt and run it directly from his butt
although he's British, so it would be cloud->arse or cloud->bum
food?
justin_smith: no recollection of rewriting of image tags, but it could be.  Just look in the Asset editors
hold on, i can come and take a quick look
have you guys seen this?  It's amazing. https://github.com/lhartikk/ArnoldC/wiki/ArnoldC
It's much better than that "Shakespeare" language, IMHO
we can interop with it in clojure!
Yeah I agree, it's easy to take a set of random tokens and make them into a simple Turing-complete language
I am going to create a language that is built around your demands on toy language designers.
No prizes for guessing what the language will be called.
how so?
THE DUDE!
THE DUDE AGAIN!

Actually it came long after NeXTStep.  It was IRIX on an SGI
I used to use SGIs, so it cuts close to the bone
I dunno NeXTStep was 1989
Yeah, I was using NeXT and SGI at the same time, and the SGI machines were a pain to use compared to the NeXTs.
Although they had the awesome 3-d filesystem browser.

Those suites sound pretty damn nice on viola.
Either that, or your cello suites recording is running a bit fast.
and it's really classing up the joint.

you need a :gen-class in your class that has main
Yeah way faster!
subsequent compiles are faster I think
yeah i was using clojure.tools.cli last night
it is pretty rad
ha yeah
justin_smith: I had to take down my pronouncement about Arizona on FB.
My hyberbole was not well-read by others.
Ooops!
I said "How can we get rid of Arizona? It's got to go."
and a minor storm in a teacup resulted.
hahahah
I love this particular piece, with its hurdy-gurdy open fifths
well, now I mean the previous one
haha
hahaha
oooh that's a good on
e
ooops!
did I do that?
looks like it could have been my hackery
ohhhh hahaha
oh right!
crazy shit
RESOURCES
ok i committed and pushed.
check out the tests to get a basic idea of what's going on
But yeah the general idea would be that it should fully render a page, during which time it accumulates a list of page resources that the page will need.   Then it should manipulate those resources in some way if needed, and inject the required tags for the page to function.
but what it does in that last bit is the key to the whole thing
yeah so the transforms are built but not wired up yet
because i was hoping to implement a generic solution for specifying the pipelines
but the code is done
transforms.clj has the transforms
each takes a vector of resources and returns a vector of resournces
hahahah I forgot that Liartownuser is NSFW

Yes it is!  It's exactly the robot universe.

oh hmpf, is it on the google group?

Yeah but it's not as bad in 6 months.  At least we get to sleep that extra hour.
Kanye is such a mega-twat
I hate that guy so much.
well, we are saving that time.
for later, I guess
I feel bad for anyone who had plans for 2:30am on Sunday
because they could never have happened
i was in my basement for most of today, except for a rainy hour when I went to my accountant
I have two friends born on Feb 29th.
Poor bastards
And one of them has an apostrophe in his name (patchwork: this is Eric O'Connell, whom you know)
so he is like a walking form-validation checker
You get used to it, I guess
Definitely.
hahah
he definitely understands the import of cool time
Amazing

right now I'm dealing with some mad dev env setup
let's just say that they're about 10 years behind in terms of tool usage
Java 7 at least
but svn
never works right
I wish
i always ran into problems... maybe it's time to try it again
ok i'll do some research.
git is to svn as svn is to nothing, i feel.
Definitely not
finally, there are bodies in here.
yo!
good good, all a bit crazy but things are slowly settling down
whassup at the outpost?
Neil gave it to everyone
true
He's Typhoid Mary
isn't it libel not slander?
good good
hahaha
working at home... it's cool for now but I doubt it'll last
the work is cool; already have some commits in
learning a shitload
I haven't touched the Java stuff much yet, just tweaked the data model a bit
They are resistant to change, so it's gonna be hard to shoehorn clojure in, but I'll find a way :)
sorry, fell off the face for a bit
yeah i am working with guys I've known for 15 years
so it's cool
he wasn't here when i dropped in a few days ago!
it made me sad
sigh, he's not being very verbose today
ha!
hahaha justin_smith i knew some of that
not the gf thing!
nice work!
what's the "probably" part?
ah
well good luck
hahaha fair enough
do you know if patchwork is around on friday? or is he busy with the game thing?
i was going to tentatively suggest lunch
Don’t drink seawater.  http://dive-shield.us/infonewspages/Underthemicroscopejustasplashofseawater.html
hahaha i don’t eat seafood
definitely can
Ahhhhhhh yes, we’re back
just don’t fucking crash my mac mini, OK?
HA!
How did that happen?
I never game him ops
WTF?!
HAHAHAHA
that’s funny.  i wonder why we never noticed that before
Great to have him back!
hahahahahha
yeah but CHANGE THE FUCKING NAME, says bitemyapp
who seems to have disappeared from clojure now that everybody blocked/ignored him
I need to go and have a good P
Well now he’s bugging people over in Haskell land
They’ll get sick of him too
ok boys, I’m outta here for now… be back on later.
toodles
you too… will ping you if I find myself with free time tonight but I sincerely doubt it
33
3333
three!
yo!
I am totally three years behind
yes indeed
frightening situation
the only person I’ve ever blocked on facebook...
woah
dude, that sucks
both the recently-ex part and the bpd part
sorry :(
ouch
perhaps that’s a classic indicator - the blocking on FB
and all medical journals should be updated to include it in the diagnosis of bpd
ah crap
jesus!
everything going ok now, or still weird?
well, it’s all for the best…
ouch
haha smart move
classic hostage-negotiation tactic
turn the place into a sauna
dude that sucks.
damn
def
def… we should all meet for lunch to celebrate
when patchwork shows up we’ll make plans
ah yes, i saw you talking about that last week.  sounds brilliant!
i saw you talking about that too
sounds super fun
hahahaha
DOGDOG!
sweet
boo
same exact thing happened to me
exactlyyyyyy
meh, it was ages ago.  and i was pretty angry by then
totally.
correct
hahaha
ha amazing grace
interesting choice
i like their russian-doll theremins
yeah and it’s a pentatonic tune i think
yeah it is, just ran it through in my head…
FUCKING STOP DYING, DOGDOG
hahaha
not familiar with him no
I rest my case.
DODGODG
DOGGOD
GODGOD
GODDOG
i thought you had died forever
oh no
hahahaha serves you right!
hahaha too funny
sweet
you’re entering the 90’s!
do it
ha
https://github.com/magnars/prone
seems like Schmetterling
yeah maybe
right
meh
haven’t seen it… what is it?
ohhh right i did hear about that
cool, i’ll put it on my list
ACK! Don’t mention DTC!
hahaha
YOOOO!
Yep… def
nothing going on, really
sweet!
a week and a half
been catching up on stuff slowly but surely
yeah for sure
it was fantastic
really exhausting but that’s kind of what you expect
yeah it was so great.  i had a blast and didn’t want to leave
although i have to admit, coming home was nice
it’s just a long time to be gone
off topic, but this popped up yesterday: https://github.com/magnars/prone
thought you might be interested
ha yeah
not interactive though, is it?
justin_smith thought it was more just a pretty exception page printer
maybe it does more?
still, it’s cool but it’s no schmetterling
might be a good opp to unify them?
schmetterling is way more useful IMHO
but he’s done a lot of work on presentation
oh really?
sweet!
awesome
yeah… i’m paid by the hour so taking so much time off was bad for the bank account
i need to get rich so I can not worry about this shit!
yeah damn it, we should be rich
there are so many fuckers out there who aren’t as smart as us getting rich
oh man it would be so easy.  But you need to be rich to start that.
The weird thing is that if you have money, it’s easy to make more money
but if you don’t have any, it’s hard to get started.
yep
haha
HAHAHAHHAHA
indeed
yeah, to somehow detect words of interest
well I’m glad you think so
holy shit, he’s better already
he will become self-aware and launch the robot invasion
ha, yeah, the reality of the modern world
do you at least get to nap on couches?
excellent!!
tons of churn over at Instrument… so many people have left
I guess that’s agency life
yeah me too - everything is very tangible
yes but we all understand the difference
Did some clojurescript-on-node.js hacking last night.  It was, um, not easy.
where is everybody?
hahah check this out: reminds me of your work with uploading to S3: http://www.martinklepsch.org/posts/using-coreasync-and-transducers-for-direct-s3-upload.html
ha!!
yeah
got some shit working, but it ain’t easy
haha
hahaha ahhh poocafe lives on
I’ve always felt that the internet has needed a better name
transducers?
been fiddling with clojurescript on node.  it’s still a bit of a junk show.  it’s a killer app if they can get it to work smoothly.
haven’t looked into clojure 1.7 yet
haha
lammmme
cljs on node has the potential to change the world of async dev
so i been trolling all over to figure out where the state of the onion might be
where do i start?
whew!
so to compile for node, you set :target :nodejs in the project file
but if you have :optimizations :none
it will compile successfully but not run
so that’s one
another is testing
it’s a real, massive, giant pain to get tests to work
even with a clojurescript port of the test framework
but that port is still in cemerick’s namespace and everything has to go through him
it should be part of the cljs core
then, it’s also a pain to write shared code
so you have to use something called cljx
which is actually kind of cool, and is how *all* clj and cljs should be written
so it shouldn’t be a thing
but part of the toolchain
anyway, i’m looking into porting stuart sierra’s whole "component" stuff to cljs so you can structure a node.js app that wa
y
because that’s one of the problems with node - dependency injection and IoC
yeah exactly
it’s a bit like C pre-proc macros
dep inj in node is a bit of a wild west situation
it’s hard to go from your generic config to starting services that can talk to each other
i mean, you have to be careful about startup ordering and who can see what and how
it’s a bit noodly
so if you have a mongo db and a mysql db and a redis server
and module X needs redis and mysql
and Y needs mongo and mysql
and Z needs X and mongo
it all gets gnarly fast
hahaha
ZALGO
 FUCK, IS IT MONDAY?
DANG
Yeah, I fucking woke up today, and it was MONDAY
Rich Hickey gotta stop adding cool shit to clj
Can’t fucking keep up.
u using it from clojure?
neo4j i men
right
i find it amusing
salty and flatulence should not be in the same sentence
totally
see?
no, I totally know that - I respond with a lot of "hahaha" and "totally"
haha
see?
haha
niiice
awesome
good good ; just finished up a massive project that has made everyone very happy
things are getting pretty crazy because the season starts in a few weeks
so I will have to head to NYC for when the puck drops for the season
it’s pretty fun that way
summer is the only time we can make big sweeping changes, and I got tasked with one of those
yeah for sure
it’s a shame they’re so stuck with Java but as far as things go, it’s not terribly bad
indeed.  although bringing in clj would be possible… ask the Daily Mail - they did it
3!
hahaha yeah I’d never have taken the gig if it had been python!
DOGDOG
hahaha
DOGDOG
haha
It’s cool technology.  Might convince people to wear watches again.
I haven’t worn a watch in a decade or more
yes
hahaha
when is someone gonna produce a bluetooth hat
yes!
"foul atonal world" is brilliant
it’s almost Shakespearian
"what a foul, atonal world has such people in’t!"
hahaha
nice.
let me see if I have acquired the U2 album unwittingly...
well, it has been added to my iCloud, but it doesn’t mean it’s been downloaded
it just means I can download it if I want it
(which I don't)
woah, U2 is herpes
(and had lots of piano)
hahahaha
we had better act now then
when shall we three meet again?
in thunder, lightning or in rain?
when the hurly-burly’s done
when the battle’s lost and won.
WHERE THE PLACE?
THERE TO MEET WITH DOGDOG
hmmm, what’s downtown?
prefer a resto to a cart
yes, i remember the carts but not so much the resto situation
right right… hmmm
talking about lunch has made me hungry
brb
can’t that same thing be done with a standard gather?
i forget!
by an unbelievable coincidence, last night I met a girl from Australia who runs a software consulting biz, and is setting up a Portland office
and is looking —exclusively— for Clojure devs
yeah I have to contact her and figure out the situation but for sure
just wanted to put it on your radar
it is just http… why are you accessing it via https?
yuck, that’s wrongo.
http://caribou.github.io/caribou/docs/outline.html is fine
ewww we should fix that.  we should also get the owernship from Instrument of the domain name and hosting
yeah you’re right, we need to fix one or the other
DOGDOG!
DODODODODODODODODOGOGOGOGODODOGOODODODOGODGO

doogdoog?
DOGDOG
justin_smith: you ever tried to play this? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4pGbFwC1s0
I never knew Strav wrote something for solo viola
yo justin_smith can you point me to where there’s a caribou typo? i couldn’t find it but don’t know what to search for
i checked everywhere i could remember writing caribou and it’s correct in all of those,,, ack!
Fucking weird, I keep getting dumped from IRC
Anyway, I haven’t changed anything - is it still a typo to you?  I can’t see it
yeah i guess - weird that it was typo to you.  I checked this morning and it was correct.
V strange
yeah probably I mistyped it ages ago when I entered it, then fixed it straight awat
but that had propagated to you already
ok, i sent a msg to Aussie chick… will let you know what she says.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zrzMhU_4m-g
GODOGOD
ouch
that sounds painful
hahahah nice
love it
GODGOD
me too
ha
e
??
justin_smith: I met with the Aussies.  The guy, Jono, is super smart and really knows his shit
anyway, he says they have a number of projects that need people, so was asking if I could connect him with you.  I told him I had on friend who was probably abel to take on some freelance clojure work
Watching Rich Hickey’s talk from StrangeLoop on Transducers
radical
yes, I will connect you guys today
meant to do it yesterday but got sidetracked
oh nice!
they’re in LA and SF?
that’s awesome!!
awesome - keep us posted about how that goes
cool cool
meh
DOGDOG!
boring doddog
hah HA HA HA
DOGDOGGGG
yeah the transducer talk is great
so patchwork I met with the aussies
they are cool
the guy said they’ve done work using clojure + neo4j for network analysis
that might sound familiar
The guy is super smart and knows his shit
anyway, aside from his meeting with justin_smith he’s here for a couple more weeks and is down to hang out with everyone if you’re keen
you might be able to get some good info on their experiences with network analysis
rad
I’ll send out an email and we can try to meet for dinner or something?
yeah justin_smith it’s a bit of a "duh" moment for Clojure - like, this has been staring at them for years
patchwork: needs people pretty much right now - he’s meeting justin_smith
tomorrow
They
are both really likable
not too many details.  they have a series of projects right now that they are gearing up but they were a bit thin on details.
(well he said they gave up on neo4j bc it wasn’t fast enough)
yes, you can prob get good info from their exp
rolled their own in-memory for what they needed
their data set wasn’t tooooo huge
hahaha
haha
I love how everyone in #clojure was getting sanctimonious about the "type-safe languages" talk from StrangeLoop
I watched it and thought it was sort-of funny and true in a slightly mean-spirited way
but still true
Definitely not a "friendly" talk
yeah
lots of "if you don’t know why X, then you’re not a good developer"
I totally agree
hahaha yes!
or in my case, perl!
justin_smith: you’re meeting Jono today?
radical
good guy
yeah haskell dev tools are super old-skool
yeah I wrote a version of the 3wp generator in Haskell years ago and was put off by the tooling
maybe yeah, like it’s some kind of self-flagellating-albino-cult
"Life is pain, princess.  Anyone who tells you otherwise is selling something."
haha
Canadian Haskell
you mean favour
if it’s Canadian, after all
hahaha
yes
hahaha
i don’t think so, i’m pretty crushed as it is
but i want to set up a meeting; they’re keen to meet you too
ok rad, i’ll send an email like i did for justin_smith
ha yeah!
no way!
was going to see if that ever happened
brilllllllllliant!!!
he’s a smart fucker
brilliant
great, glad it worked out
wow, people have a really low opinion of the competence of prostitutes
exactly
good luck.  say hi
yeah he talked about that
DOGDOGDOG
how so?
boo
well, you never know.
ha
patchwork: have you seen that you can now buy a small 3d printer for $399?  http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00MXIAALQ/ref=s9_dcbhz_bw_g328_i4_pd
apparently you can even buy it assembled for $399 from some vendors
Make: magazine did a whole issue on it this month
there are a few sub-$1000 printers that are good, they say
I really want dogdog to remember this forever: http://s3-ec.buzzfed.com/static/2014-09/22/7/enhanced/webdr01/enhanced-buzz-25254-1411385269-14.jpg
hahaha
hahahaha
ha
dogdog’s three-word-poems are great today
hahaha that’s hilarious
3!
Can I have an invite!?!?!
dogdog give me a three word poem
https://github.com/quile/gravity-kraken
if only i had a project with that name
heh
hahaha
Definitely
Indeed, a great day.
DOGDOG DOG ODG ODGOODGODOGODOGDOGODGODOGODGODOGDOGD
hahaha just read #clojure
"fuck me, the frontend guy…"
justin_smith: is that teague?
jesus
man, my sentence templates are all one-word.
hahahaha
I can’t get him to say more than one word.
meh, you’re boring today.
clearly, but you’ve been training him with your D O G sentences
Zalgo
Hmm, sometimes my IRC client doesn’t render it correctly.
ZALGO!
that is rad - it has antlers
hard core in fact
hahahaha Love it.  Tim Baldridge is a smart fucker.
NO!  HOW!????!?!?!
snort snort
jesus
ahhhh hahahaha
bring it on
ewwww
dude everyone uses wordpress
everyone.
hence the problem
yeah being pwned is major suckage
it happened to us one time at idealist way back
I need to train him with longer sentences so I’m going to make a point of entering them daily.
But I have to be careful (presumably) to vary my vocabulary when I do so - otherwise he’ll just parrot the same words back at me
ahahaha
add adjective orchestral
Oh man
He’s taunting me with shorter and shorter responses.
DOGDOG
I am trying to retrain our favourite IRC bot with much longer sentences than I usually utter.
Obviously it will take some time to start having a major effect.
no cheating, it’s all part of The Game
I just have to make sure not to respond with so many short responses, and instead be a lot more verbose
so no more "hahahaha" and "ok" and "yep" and all that; much longer sentences.  That’s the ticket.
Well, exactly, that’s what I’m getting at, as I am in complete agreement with you about everything you said in your last missive.
Yes, life is a battle between either focusing one’s energy on frivolous and easy activities, or harnessing that energy for the fight against evil or artlessness.
OK, that elicited a LOL I have to admit.
OMFG this is awesome
I got a new iPhone 6, so I was testing Siri out, so I asked her "Hey Siri, what is the airspeed velocity of an unladen swallow?"
She responded immediately with "The last person that asked me that ended up in a crevasse"
yeah it was floating around the clj newsletters a while back.  very cool indeed.
Dogdog.
Yes, it’s all about averages.  I’ll continue to train him with longer and longer goop.
And I’ll also train him to use some words more than others.  Balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls balls.
You’re balls right.  Balls need to use the balls balls in different balls parts of speech. Balls.
You’re safe from balls intrusions.
Dogdog will not sneak his balls into too many of his balls responses.
The sound of my amusement is echoing throughout my house.
I totally agree with you.  You need to be cautious.
Good morrow to you all, friendly chatsters.  Hail and well-met.
patchwork: we talked about this particular nobbly-wobbly goody-woody spiffily-wiffily piece of software: https://docker.com/
Shit balls damn arse still batting a low average with the big dog x 2
You speak with great verity.
Your utterances are laden with words of truthiness.
yes it’s totally overflowing with juicy, beautiful greatness
Good morrow, all and sundry, whose visages please me greatly with their presence (either expected or unexpected).
This is way too consonant for justin_smith http://gizmodo.com/heres-what-the-higgs-boson-sounds-like-when-scientist-m-1642062270
Well, no, I wasn’t planning on using either in Haskell, since you asked.
Do you want to try to use it in Haskell?
Well, I think you’re associated Haskell with lunch.  And as we all know, that’s a bad idea.
Don’t you agree?
wow that looks brilliant
I went into Instrument today
They hired a new hot receptionist
and an Australian named Kyle!
Olesya is still there, they just hired another hot receptionist
They moved a lot of stuff around too, but overall the vibe was familiar.
Briefly talked to Phong and Vin, otherwise just hung with J5
Jesus, this voice recognition thing is getting nutso
I just said out loud: "Hey Siri, can you remind me to leave at 5:20pm?"
and my phone picked it up and said "OK, I’ll remind you to leave at 5:20pm."
I know.
Frightening and awesome
Oh, and I got rear-ended on my way home and my car had to be towed.  FUCK THAT.
yeah crap
well, it wasn’t a bad knock but was a pain
now my car has to be fixed and i have to deal with all the nonsense
but nobody was hurt so it’s all good
that one i’ve heard of
oh yeah totally
and poor jodi had to deal with all the nonsense too
what a fuckup that guy was
Nice to hear.  Maybe you have been learning something from people in the room.
Good good… well, as good as going to NY can be, I guess
Happy to be back on the best coast
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
That is amazing
justin_smith: random numbers in Haskell is like pulling teeth
exactly
easier way I found:  ask SQLite to generate a random number for me
delegate randomness.
I think I need that on a shirt.
I work that crazy stuff too.
putting, as in golf?  or putting, as in the opposite of getting?
oh cool, Max had his baby

"fake plastic trees" is a three word poem
Although real three-word-poets steer away from plurals.

it’s so good
what a brilliant tool
HA HA HA HA AH AH AH AH AHA HA AH HA AH A AHH AHA HAHA HA H AH AH AHA
indeed it does - it’s nice to see balls balls making an appearance finally
ACK! mono-syllablic single word responses are soooooo 2013, dude
had to restart my machine to upgrade to next version of OSX
Well that’s no good!
it is!  without it, balls, I think we’d balls be balls less happy.
yo patchwork what up
i am totally down for lunch
indian sounds rad.
i got into a rear-end fender-bender a couple of weeks ago on 11th
not quite as spectacular as yours
and had no trouble at all with insurance - the guilty party’s insurance paid for all the repairs to my car.
yikes, what a clusterfuck that must have been
For me it was a series of pleasant, human interactions with very nice people at multiple insurance companies
Gonna reboot and upgrade OSX… wish me well.
.. shit, gonna wait on the upgrade.  Have to be online in 30 mins or so.
wow, that almost made sense in a perverse kind of way.

ouch
hahaha it’s not an image I want right now
this is true
ack, tomorrow not gonna work.  I can do today or Thursday or Friday
Good good
Been trying to eke out some time in the evenings for some Clojuring but failing!
Too much to do before baby arrives.  ARGH!
Yeah that’s what I expect
Lots of spare time
I know.  Something that’s time-consuming and detail-oriented.
Nov 18th or thereabouts.
awesome
one is definitely a number justin_smith
hahaha!
yes!
SEVEN
You never know when Numberwang is going to happen.
That sounded like a line from a hollywood movie/tv show that would be spoken by a "hacker" at a computer
justin_smith: good idea
right now it’s only a few lines - definitely room for improvement
hahaha
good question
Yes, sorry to chime in late - it’s definitely Stoppard over Beckett
Plus, there’s a nice Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead : Hamlet paraller
parallel
frogfish?
i mean, i know, but it’s a bit spurious
hahahaha
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
DOGDOG WILL BE EXCITED ABOUT CAPS LOCK DAY
patchwor`: what’s with the weird nick?
IRC is so weird sometimes.
So strange.
for sure!
I’m running into the sharp corners of clojurescript-on-node already …
it’s fun but we take a lot for granted in clojure that we get for free from Java
and none of that exists in cljs
for example: streams
HAHAHAHAHAHAH
OMFG
HAHAHAHAA
That is fucking priceless
I think we need to preserve that for all time.
well nobody has implemented the clojure-style stream abstraction on top of node’s streams
node’s streams are all callback-based
so you can use them, but it’s ugly
better would be to have a channel-based abstraction
Yes
That’s the whole point really - programming node.js is callback hell
so using core.async makes it all pretty
yeah but no transducers in cljs yet I think
the latest cljs?
i’ll need to look into that
yeah there’s a giant different between php guys and perl guys in my experience
jesus
but anyway, so are you saying that if i use the clj 1.7 alpha, and the latest cljs, i will have transducers?
(in cljs)
cool cool
php is a taint.  in both senses of the word.  if you have it on your resume, it will ruin you forever.  also, it is somewhere between the asshole and the balls.
whatever works for you guys
wait, are we still talking about indian?
ok
i would be down for indian or hawaiian, whatever is clever
yeah 11:30 too early
can do 12:00
awesome
sigh.

I def need to work on it a bit more - it’s like 3 lines right now
don’t use 3 - it will trigger a poem
it wrks on a per message basis, not per number
THREE
… and obviously a bit of a ladies’ man
poem please
Ah, you were avoid justin_smith.  I understand.  His D O G sentences are harsh.
hahaha
ha http://imgur.com/iE6RKKU
yeah that was one of my favourites
DOG DOG
of course you do.
jeez DD, you’re boring today
so it’s nothing to do with it being the 27th of october, DD?
ewww technical debt
boo
Sucking balls. Balls balls sucking balls.

YES!!!!
THAT’S NUMBERWANG!
Kebab yes
THE BOARD OF KEBAB
SCIENCE.
that’s deep
sweet
it’s going, just.
using React for UI, which is fun.
Angular sucks festering monkey nuts.
Dogdog can quote me on that.
hahaha
React is definitely superior IMHO
Angular is a lot of magic
All kinds of stuff you can’t control
React has hardly any magic at all
And is much faster and more sensible
yep, nailed it
You should have seen the struggles the Nike team had
AND IT’S NUMBERWANG!!
python 3? python 2.7?  python 2.8?  WHO KNOWS

playing with another clojurebot justin_smith ?
How’s this for hilarity: http://astonj.com/tech/ruby-is-about-to-get-red-hot-again/
Pretty sure it’s rearranging deckchairs on the Titanic
I’ve noticed that he keeps running but drops out of the channel quite often
so I have to kill him and start him again
It’s weird that he’d get booted while still running.
patchwork: you’ll enjoy this: http://astonj.com/tech/ruby-is-about-to-get-red-hot-again/
BECAUSE RUBY IS ABOUT TO GET RED HOT AGAIN
I can’t wait until I can program the browser in RUBY
Think what that means!!
method_missing on the browser!!
Yes, you have been this before
History will repeat itself.

Well, I always try to go on the Saturday show, because Sunday is filled with bluehairs and Monday is too late in the evening.
The problem is that all of it could be scrapped if the baby decides to arrive
so it’s hard to make solid plans
But I def want to hear Mahler FIVE LIVE
I don’t think I’ve heard it live since 1989.
exactly
Am a bit worried…
… that baby could ruin my plans!
hahah
Yeah, fuck, the fifth is so rad
Well, we could keep an eye on ticket avail - I suspect it’ll be OK to buy them on the night
or at the very least just a few days before
I’m glad you agree with me
i don’t that would be too useful for you.
I’m not really doing on cljs in the browser so no, haven’t used any of those tools
server-side cljs with node is a different beast basically
FUCK YES DOGDOG IT’S AWESOME
Well, you just need to have some fun.
Go on, be spontaneous.
hahaha totally
although honestly he’s getting a pretty traditional sense of holidays via his mother and her family
Americans make a big deal out of holidays
eg. in NZ we have nothing like Thxgiving or 4th of July - there’s no pomp and circumstance around things like that
and when we do have a longish holiday, like Easter (?!) and Xmas, people just go on vacation
and some "holidays", like Nov 11, are not really holidays in the "day off" and instead are marked with solemnity due to their origins
"day off sense"
ha, yep
definitely true - no doubt about it.
ahhh ok
he’s even mastered the "not" joke.
Yeah he’s busted some balls out a few times.

WE ALL HAVE FREE WILLY
nothing with a 3 in it can be numberwang
not in its current uber-simple form, anyway
I thought you already got numberwang
ah yes, you will.  but it takes a lot of skill and planning to get numberwang.
not just anyone can do it.
boom!
where’d smitho go?
hey
sorry i was carving a pumpkin
did you point him in my direction somehow?
I missed it - wasn’t lurking in #clojure
ok i’ll keep an eye out for him
i bet it was that the guy had to use node.js and figured it would be better to write in cljs than js
I have to say that node.js has exceptional reliability
but writing async JS is painful
so core.async is the answer
the JVM (or clojure running on it maybe) has the odd reliability issue… memory problems or socket problems or somesuch
prob more due to code written in the jvm than the jvm itself
but I have been impressed with node - it’s hard to fuck it up.
because it’s aggressuively single-threaded
Oh god this hurts my eyeballs.  http://www.pixelmonkey.org/2014/11/02/clojonic
disordered calculating oil in Haskell is better than rad
why not drop him in and see what happens?
,(int justin_smith)
FUCK
,(inc justin_smith)
(inc justin_smith)
ah ok
no comma
justin_smith: you around?
yo
so… I might have a wee bit of paid work for you if you have a bit of time in the next few days
it’s linux + audio
mostly linux
we are supposed to be demoing some of our audio matching stuff to a company in the UK
they have given us login to a machine over there that has an maudio card and 20 inputs
yeah, problematic tho
because machine has nothing on it otherwise, yet we need sox, our own maudio exec, a JVM and my clojure-based broadcaster
oh, you won’t have to repeat that, apparently the maudio card is already all set up
sorry, it’s a binary called "maudio" but is something we wrote to read an audio stream from stdin and puke out fingerprints on stdout
it seems like an old linux - do you know the redhat family
?
i am not that familiar with them
yeah, and I’m fucking clueless
cool - can i ping you tomorrow with detailed info and get you connected?
hahaha these two
rad dude
will have more info tomorrow too - we can figure something out
I’m considering attending the clojure meetup tonight… anyone else?
I don’t think EFI will be there.
cool bro, should see you there
radical - i gotta be downtown a bit early.  meet up?
NOT A HUMAN DOGDOG!
TeaZone?  Get a cuppa and some happy hour eats?
http://www.teazone.com/
hmmm says it’s only open until 6
I could meet there at 5?
Cool
justin_smith: ?
Short hike from there to Clojure meetup
YES!!!
NUMBERWANG!
… Does the what?
justin_smith: ^^ patchwork and i mentioned meeting at 5 at TeaZone
godgod
GODGOD
ok, go
just sent u some info on the server in the UK
rad
ha
yo
would love an update when you get a sec
I was working on everything last night and the server stuff and the matching of the audio is working wel now
well, sox is just what we were using to grab the audio - anything else is fine as long as the format is correct
wait where does 12 come from?
i thought the cards had 8
oh ok
yeah there are 20 spread across three cards
ohhh right
ok
can we pipe the unused ones to /dev/null
?
oh so we need something to go from 48k 32bit to 16k 16bit?
resample in sox - I am def not comfortable changing the code in the maudio exec at this point
no 8k is too low - we need 16k
haha anybot is a weirdo
huh
?
not really
:(
haha
so can you use arecord and tee to grab all the distinct streams, throw away the unused ones, and have sox instances read the others?
ok
ahhh ok
so, question:
can you run multiple arecord instances on a single card?
well consider this:
if you can run N arecord processes
then you could have a unix pipeline that goes arecord -> sox ->maudio
and then broadcaster itself could start up 20 of those
and connect to the output
from that system proc
well wait
is it possible to run sox and have it directly read from any one of the channels on any of the cards?
like, do we even need arecord?
oh
hmmm, they use alsa with these cards all the time at Kantar
so it must work
crap.  I guess I just hoped the inputs would show up as different sox devices and you could use -d to change it up
ok
seems to me that if arecord piped into sox can work, and we can run multiple of those
then that’s the way to go
that’s fine - sox isn’t too mugh of a hog, right?
great
cool cool, i’ll report to those guys on your progress
yes, I understand
well keep me posted and lemme know if you run into any roadblocks ASAP
yeah that will be tricky but we’ll figure out some way to do it.
well, the most important thing is that broadcaster sends each input up on a different channel
you can use 8 through 28
well, yes, true - it’s pretty easy to eyeball the fingerprints coming out of broadcaster to know if they’re genuine audio or not
awesome
right now broadcaster gets its channel from the config but it can be overriden on the cmd line
yes, I can def help with that
Radical
Just e-introduced you to the guys, so they’re not faceless entities
nameless rather
haha
hahaha yeah totally
patchwork:
"gustatory rhinitis" - solid diagnosis
Now I know what the problem is!
what exactly are you doing with the dec mongodb?  I don’t understand the significance
No, I get that
but why the floating point num?
It’s the condition that I have!
haha yeah it’s related to the condition people have who sweat profusely when they eat capsaicin
it’s a neurological thing where there’s crosstalk in the vagus nerve
it’s treatable but it’s not al allergy
although it turns out I have a very very mild milk allergy
too mild to be a huge factor but I was surprised to see it
Was super fun to see some cool science at work
some funky thing that numbs the nerve - very minor but apparently quite effective
we’ll see if it works!
snort!
some kind of nose spray thingy
oh dude, I’m sorry :(
what’s the prob?
schweet
ah yeah, if I remember right, sox is sensitive to ordering?
haha
sigh
radical dude, I’ll inform Paymaan and he can verify
so at this point, you are getting simultaneous fingerprints out of numerous channels
?
raddddd
well done homes
nice man
haha teeeee
so raw audio is ~/juked/raw and prints in ~/juked/processed?
yep
rad
well done dude
hmmm, I downlaoded the processed/ files and can’t get them to play - it looks like some of them have legit data in them (although some are just 0x00 and 0xff all over the show)
lemme try audacity
sorry i meant raw/
that’s what I downloaded
can’t play any of them
almost certainly pebcak
ha!  works in audacity
fantastic!
nah you’re good - something wrong with my invocation of sox to play them
worked fine in audacity
weird listening to all these British TV channels
thx dude, will make it easier for numties like me
haha well I don’t.  Those guys will be ok.
I think this is going to be pretty cool
cool
COOL
haha, anybot is case-sensitive
haha
hahaha
it’s cool but kinda hard with digits > 3
hahaha
totally
yeah it might be that easy - and rather than using *in* you just get that input stream from somewhere else
you’ll need to beef up the config to tell it how to acquire streams and which channel to broadcast on
wait - start-reference-stream is not used right now, I think
oh no it is
you’re right
so broadcaster just reads the ascii output from maudio and turns it into a line-seq
is that exactly what you’ll do, just not with *in*?
sounds like a plan
feel free to add to the config
yeah no worries
dude you’re rocking it
such a massive help
I know!  Let’s hope this comes to something, and then there’ll be more work :)
Radical - ping me tomorrow - I should be around most of the day
and lemme know if you run into any weirdness
I can help you figure out if broadcaster is working
oh ha!  thanks… it was thrown together pretty quickly
and there’s a lot to be desired
but it does its job very reliably
it’s really all line-seq that does it!
that’s a fucking piece of built-in genius right there
Rich Hickey is a god
hahah
There’ll be some other weirdness prob - the fact that a realtime stream is tied to a channel with :file "-" is a bit annoying
because it means there’s only one of them
so that will have to bend a bit
no, it comes from the config file
if you look in there, there’s a "reference" definition that has :file "-" and :channel 8 or something
that tells broadcaster that stdin is to be posted to channel 8
oh yeah bin->hex might be a bit busy, I have never revisted
but I do remember this being more complicated than it looked
because of Java’s dopey handling of signed bytes
vs unsigned bytes
yeah I can’t quite remember the details but yeah
right
I spent some time on stackoverflow looking for stuff and remember striding into a bit of a minefield
but I’m sure it should be way easier
haha yeah but way less readable.  and remember that it’s coming in as ASCII
the best thing would be to have maudio spit out binary
actual binary, i mean
and then just read the bytes
but for debugging purposes we’ve kept everything ascii
and it’s never been an issue bc performance is never an issur
e
hahaha fair enough for shiz
:)
you would have loved perl back in the day...
greatest one-liner language of all
no but I can imagine...
hahaha
yeah that would be right i think
it should map input to channel number
and you can use 8-27
actually let me find the canonical list of channels that they’re recording so we can try to map them in order
yep
same path
that’s just the endpoint that they’re posted to
I added a PDF of the TV channel list to the repo
Not sure if you’ll be able to make sense of it, but if possible we’d like to have the channels 8-27 in the right order
might be hard to figure that out, tho
so don’t sweat it too much
on the pdf?
yeah that’s all I meant
actually let me see, maybe I can get 1-20 free, hang tight
ok, I was able to set up 1-20 so use those exact numbers
I’m not sure if you can tell from that PDF which audio is which though, can you?
like, can you tell which one is BBC1?
yeah in that order
HAHAHAHAHAHAHA
seriously?
schweet
of course
Clint
love it
Amazeballs… let me check the server
ok, it takes 6 minutes to accumulate enough input to post it up
has it been running that long?
hahahah
so I am not seeing it on the server
are you seeing it execute the POST?
also, just FYI, so you have some sense of what this thing does…
I added the audio of a song to audio that I’m streaming to it from my machine, which has been running for a few days using broadcaster
then Paymaan took the audio from that song and distorted it and overlaid other tracks on top of it
and when he feeds that distorted audio to the system
it locates the song at the exact time I played it
even though the audio it’s using to locate is heavily distorted
=> big win
it plucks it out of 48 hours of continuous audio, no problemo
hahaha you’re on fire with numberwang
stuff is arriving at the server
No we have no idea which channels on their list map to which channels on each card
that’s the tricky bit
We can ask them if they know - but they probavbly don’t...
That’s less important - more important is that we’re getting the audio in on a consistent channel
well, that will be overkill - we only need 20
we just need to figure out which 20
and then somehow figure out which real TV channel each virtual input maps to
ok, I just made channels up to 36 for you, so you can 1-36 for those
dude they’re posting like mad!~
stop them!!!!
like crazytown, flooding server
ACK!  still happening
had to stop server
definitely still posting
flooding channels 1 and 2
hmmm how could it be 0 length if it’s waiting for N lines on a line-seq?
Ahhhh that would make sense - I saw that once before a long time ago when I stopped broadcaster - I suspect the sox process died first, and broadcaster went nuts for a bit while it was terminating
for sure
yes def
yeah that is prob the best
awesome
ok the flooding has stopped - I’ve started the server again
heh
haha
hahahah yeah it was thousands of them
poor server
hey also: could you set the date on the kantar server to be the actual time UTC?  it’s slow by about 8 or 9 minutes
which is fucking some stuff up on our server
nooooo
because we have to trust the input from the client
because the client is what ties the broadcast to a time - we have no way of knowing *when* the client actually recorded these fingerprints
so we have to trust what it tells us
no, just 8 minutes or so
now it’s wrong
by an hour
in the UK right now it’s 20:04
20:04GMT
Boom!
we might need to get it even more precise since we’ll be tying this to broadcast times, but I doubt it will matter for now
Besides, there’s always some random delay in broadcasts, whether it be satellite or streamed or free-to-air
OK, so let me know when you feel like it should be broadcasting correctly for chans 1 and 2 and I’ll verify on theserver
and then you can expand it out to more channels
ahh smart
yes, make it a multiple of 32 and we’re good to go
1440 is six minutes, 32 is 8 seconds
yeah
the phones upload in chunks of 32
and when we do live stream matching the broadcaster does 32 as well, but for this we need bigger chunks ultimately
it’s fine to test with 32 tho
i saw the chunks on the server, and it’s not flooding so that’s good
no flooding
can you be sure to reset to 1440
sweet dude
oh rad
i see them all but they’re coming too fast
like every minute
1440 is 6 minutes
ah right that’s every 32 s
yeah i see them all - can you reset to 1440 and let it run?
great
great
still coming every 32s
classic mistake, I do it all the time
yeah it’s still doing 32s
ha gotcha
yeah that’s why the config file is the first argument to the command line
!
haha
ok
this is awesome.  I saw the first batch come in, no prob
waiting for the second to make sure timing is correct
hello, dolly
second round arrived
is there any way you can also capture some slices of audio from the inputs, or is it hard given that arecord is grabbing the incoming audio
?
it would be cool to be able to use a few slices to test with
haha
yeah probably should test before going to nutso
we need to make sure that the roundtrip from the matching side works
yes but it has to be the same audio that’s gone into broadcaster
yeah that would be good tho
let’s get all channels if that’s easy
then Paymaan can download and test random bits and pieces
and see if it matches what broadcaster is sending up
NO, SHELL SCRIPTS ARE THE BEST EVAR
schweeeet
let’s get at least 6 minutes’ worth
hmmm haven’t received another batch yet - and 6 minutes have passed
ok, i saw that come through at 13:27:20
so expect the next ones at 13:33:20 or thereabouts
yeah def
no i don’t think so - agent pool is fine
we don’t care about the response really
so fire-and-forget is good
hey, didn’t receive the second batch on schedule
1440 / 32 = 45
45 * 8s = 360s or 6 minutes
is the bitrate wrong?
hmm
yeah i see no reason to doubt it - it was working great before when you weren’t recording as well
wanna take the recording out and see?
sorry, i know it’s a pain
ok cool, without the recording?
ok let’s see if it makes a diff
we’ll see…
ok first chunks arrived
i expect the next chunks around 13:52:00
yeah so it seems
weird!
totally
sorry was away from keyb
i saw a batch come in at 14:08:20
or thereabouts
ok, they came in at roughly the right time
sure, then start it back up again without the recording
so we don’t miss too much
it’s good to accumulate real audio fingerprints - makes our testing more valuable
sweet dude!
I’ll wait for a bit more data and then get Paymaan onto it
cool, although we’ll need to record all three at some point too; doesn’t matter when
grrrrreat
yeah that will help
should you be sending chunks?
ok
i got 13-24
but not 1-12
where?
yeah not part of this - it’s part of sending "meter bundles" which we don’t need to worry about
what we are sending is called "reference data", as opposed to "meter data" which is what comes in from phones/devices
yep
some of the others are coming in sporadically
5 and 6 came up
just got 3 and 9
10
so they’re coming in
just got two for channel 7
which is, well, odd
yeah it’s possible - we should def not be getting repeat posts within the 6-minute window.  You can reduce the window to debug if you want
but don’t make it too small or we won’t be able to tell
yeah cool, nw
running out to pharmacy…. bbiab
yeah man, go for broke!
radical dude
it’s fine, all good
which transient issues?
yeah it’s a bit odd for sure
wtf?!
but you’re not posting now, right?
ok, will let you know when I see it
ah yes I see 20 twice
and a few others
i see nothing > 24 - did you def add them to the config?
sweet, what was the problemo?
oh I missed that
hahah
you clearly have plasma pontiff amnesia.
amazing man, so awesome
lemme know when you have the .wavs and I’ll grab them and give them a listen
I won’t be able to test them bc I don’t have a phone with the right software but Paymaan can do it
well ideally we’ll run the audio into the matching system and it will tell us exactly when it occurred in real life
and that should correlate with the log times
oh and I’m logging the uploads on the other end
so don’t worry about that right now
hahaha
yo justin_smith
would it be possible to run the broadcaster?  or are you tweaking doing stuff?
the more data we collect, the better
ah
it hasn’t been running since yesterday
awesome, thx!
any idea what shuts it down?
ack… well, maybe just run it in a for(;;;) look
loop
haha
ah
ok
ah yeah
no sweat - I just figured you brought it down to work on something
we can also have the server detect if it’s not receiving, and ping me or something
awesome, it’s brilliant - I’ll keep it running.  just tell me if you need to work on it.
cool
totally
yeah dude no worries
justin_smith: FYI Paymaan just did a test, with the phone, of audio from BBC 1, BBC 2, ITV1 and ITV2, and it worked brilliantly
IT IS FUCKING AWESOME
wha?
fuck
thx
looks like it last uploaded at 11:34
weird
don’t worry about it today
I will keep an eye on it
awesome dude, thx!
he didn’t last
hahahah I bet
I have been abusing caffeine in such a way for just over 3 years.
yeah cool
COOL
where is anybot?
jahja
hahahah
i just expected him to say something when I said cool
amazing
Surely, that’s numberwang?
ha, cool
hah
hahaha
bots talking to each other is hilarious
yo are you working on broadcaster?
just wondering if I should be kicking it when it goes down or if it’s just down bc you’re in there beating it with a stick
I noticed that it seems to stay up for ~2 hours and then die - smells of OOM problem
ok, it’s just that it always seems to happen at the same time
things stay up for ~2 hours
and then splat
whereas i feel like buffer probs could happen any time
just a gut, could be anything of course
well it does buffer up the fingerprints in a buffer, but those should get truncated
(the fixed-length buffer was an artifact from an earlier version)
radical - don’t let me get in the way of that!
oh shit, sorry, i just went in and was fiddling - didn’t know you were doing stuff
ok cool
sweeeeet
ok
well wait, we have to be careful not to go overboard just for this demo
most important thing is that it runs and doesn’t crash
ok
I guess I’m worried about rabbit holes - it’s almost entirely correct right now, but something is killing it every 2 hours
ok cool cool
haha
right
ok cool
yo justin_smith you around?
@seen justin_smith
around now...
briefly
oh it’s no substitute for doing it the right way
but you weren’t around and they needed to test
well now that those guys are on GMT and can test on the ground with real audio, they need to be able to know that the channels are being fingerprinted, but obviously it’s not ideal if there’s a blip every hour!
but they can easily work around that for now
yeah give it a bit more time but be wary of the rabbit hole - this is just a demo so we only need to work for the demo - it’s not a production system
yeah that’s fine, but I just asked the guys whether they need more than what they’ve got now.  If the current situation is acceptable then we can hold off on further tweaking.
yeah I’ll have them loop you in on correspondence
ok - I’m gonna disappear for a bit but will check back in later.  Catch u then
yo just sat down to check in… what up?
justin_smith nope!  how about now?
yo how about now?
yo justin_smith
yo yo yo, just sending you some email
does it have to do with the other stuff that they were doing?
HA
let’s ask
one sec
i’ll skype
let’s see if we can get this sorted
maybe the card got locked up
they say no, they haven’t tried anything
w can reboot… wanna give it a go?
yeah go
yeah def
the card is still locked?
ok
is the data coming from arecord?
you mentioned fiddling with buffer sizes - did you make any changes to that?
ok
well, let’s check the pipeline first - make sure that arecord is spewing data or not
then make sure the maudio exec is fingerprinting it
then make sure broadcaster is pushing data to the server
I have to run upstairs for a sec but will be right back
Let’s just be methodical
Also, the guys said actually it’s ok for us to bring broadcaster up and down today
and they don’t care about today’s back audio
but we just need to be running reliably from tonight about midnight onwards
bbiab
no, our midnight
they’re heading into Kantar in the morning so we need to be done by 8am their time
any luck with arecord?  we can shut everything off and just go through each part in turn
I know but have you shut everything off and verified each step?  I think that’s what we need to do before anything else
ok, and then you verified that arecord is spewing out audio? or not?
ok
and you use tee to grab that and pass it to maudio, right?
let’s go back to basics and get it to work with a single channel from 1-12
Oh right, sox first
haha, a lot of numberwang going around
anyway, let’s get broadcaster listening to ^^ that pipeline
so we know the card is functioning - something else is bent somewhere in our chain
yeah but we need to prune things back to find the problem
because as you say, everything looks right
well it should be shouldn’t it?
hmm
ok
looks like you also renamed the fifos at some point?
and commented out fifo 9 on card 0?
so that’s a change too
about 8 hours ago?
yeah i see that
I’m just pointed out differences
pointing
hahaha
ls -lt of fifos
sorry ten hours ago
8 hours ago for the card-x-y-fifo
but channel 9’s fifo was last used:
2014-11-16 14:51 0-9-fifo
right, i see that we’re only using x-y-fifo
and channel 9 was last used ~10 hours ago
presumably when you removed it
from broadcaster’s config
is it possible that arecord is blocking because one of the fifos is not being drained?
and it’s getting backpressure?
let’s set broadcaster to work on all channels
and see if anything changes
try doing that, restart everyone, and see if it picks up again.  something is different about card 0, and that’s one difference
?
ha
-> backpressure!
hahaha no! don’t worry, this shit is fucking tricky, always helps to have a second pair of eyes
let’s verify it’s working, then you can go back to your newer clojure-controlled version and see if it works now
is that oK?
dude, no, thank YOU
paymaan and ravosh are so stoked to have you on the project
holy flying fucking spaghetti monster I REALLLLY hope this demo works
and they convince Kantar to give us lots of MONEY
ohhh right… you’re helping ravosh with that too, right?
we have a couple of days to get that dialled
but I won’t be available at all after tomorrow
but you seem to have things under control!
I have to run out for a bit but will be back online tonight
I know, you are a rockstar
so before you go to sleep, send me email about where you get to - so I know if I need to go in and fiddle with crontabs and stuff
YESS!
right on
are you gonna leave this guy running then?
I can play with the crontab to get it to restart without losing so much data
cool cool, thx dude
if you’re up before midnight PST lemme know
or if you do any work while I"m gone
but otherwise, go sleep
yes, I was going to diddle with that a bit
super easy solution is to restart 30 seconds after the hours
hour
then 60 seconds after the hour
then 90
or whatever
I’ll play with it
does broadcaster log stderr to anywhere?
yep but you need sleep, I’ll try not to bug
OK perf
thx man
good plan, in case
ok, catch u later
yo dude, I’m back
sounds like you’re making great prog
let me check the server and see if it looks kosher on this end
ha ok, I’ll poke around on our server and make sure it’s sending up quality fingerprints
ok great
I won’t touch anything on the kantar box
well wait - don’t try to bite too much off
rock on.  ok you’re in the driver seat on the kantar box.
HA!
he knows what we’re talking about
yeah it does so far
but it needs to stay up > 2 at least
remember that the old version died regularly around the 2 hour bmark
me too
good plan
awesome dude
keep on keeping on
hopefully it’ll make it to 3...
heh
heh yeah - def something for later if this comes to anything
We actually have the maudio code in Java too but not quite usable yet
but if it were, it could all be in a single clj process
yeah that’s the ultimate goal but it all goes tits up if we don’t make progress with Kantar I think
rock on dude
heh
THREE
cool cool
yo so I think they’re starting their stuff in London now - fingers crossed
awesome dude
let’s not touch anything :)
brilliant
I just sent email - I need to sleep but tonight I can be reached if needed.  Not so for tomorrow night, so…
cheers & thanks again, couldn’t have done this without you, no matter what happens
yo justin_smith yt?
great news on the boratcaster
sad news on the killing of box 2… what happened?
ah well c’est la vie
SuSE WTF
heheh
don’t worry, Paymaan is ok with stuff like that - it happens
what’s the status at this point with box 2?
great
you mean for box 2?
ok cool
sweet dude
yeah it’s shite innit
hahaha
well, that hardcoded path might not be used - Ravosh doesn’t even use windows
grt
sorry i’m gonna be on and off for the rest of the day
but will be checking in
hahah
speaking of system clocks - box 1 is still a minute or more off
we should fix that at some point
cool
ha
No you are not
ha
ok keep an eye on it - bc system time is critical for this work
yeah as long as it realigns itself periodically, that’s ok
yo just had a quick chat with the guys
yt justin_smith? or are you catching some zzzzs?
yeah cool - so we talked about which channels are live or not
we’re going to leave them all on, so don’t filter
(i am talking about box1 here)
I will handle filtering post-hoc
yep
well, actually, i’ll just ignore those unused channels when I build the reference data
yes, but some of the channels don’t broadcast at night
so we can’t use that right now
channel 12 is definitely live
and we have the matches to prove it - for sure it’s BBC1
anyway, all good
I don’t think so no
can’t imagine how
that should be live
yeah
hm
something up
agreed
well I
yep
ok cool
justin_smith: qq
NUMBERWANG FUCK YEAH
ok
that would explain why we’re seeing BBC1 on input 12
so it’s not wrapping around
hmmm ok
k, just wanted to be sure
ok, all good, just wanted to be sure.  it’s a classic off-by-one [mod 12] error tho, so wanted to make sure it’s not happening here
cool cool
no, but that’s not what I’m saying - i know the sox and broadcaster have all their numbers right
the thing that’s talking to the cards is arecord
ok, it’s fine - it’s just very odd that’s all
but whatever, no need to sort it out now
no i see that - i just wanted to eliminate the possibility that it’s 0indexed, not 1
but cool, you’ve been thru this, no problemo
if arecord delivered those 32-bit words and sox expects them to start at 0, not 1, so specifying 12 would give you 0
but yes, i see that you’ve gone thru everything - am just double checking
right
yeah, it would be weird
and it would have to be exactly 32 bits
but that would shift everything the right amount to give us this weird numberwang
numbering i mean
haha
ah well, i’m perfectly content right now considering it a mystery we don’t need to solve
if everything’s running fine, fuck it
but if anything comes of this, we might have to chase it more.  but right now, i’m content.
rad
undoubtedly… that will be job 1 if we get any work out of this
for sure - which is a big bonus
and has always been my goal with this side of the equation
the server side is node.js and will stay that way
but hey, there’s always cljs...
MOTHERFUCKING PROMENADE BITCHES
!!
good good.  so. fucking. tired.
he’s always confident
yeah, she’s actually a good sleeper - but doesn’t like to sleep unless she’s held
so we have to wean her off that requirement
you can, you’ve just repressed those memories.
ha yes
good - she’s recovering quickly and Callum has been so cute with his baby sister
so that’s all cool, just realllllly hard to juggle the two kids, and sleeping and getting stuff done
Tara can’t do anything at all for another week or so
So i have to do most of the driving/dishes/laundry/etc
although she’s up and about and already doing some stuff
well, i only get paid if i work
so i have taken a week off but I need to work again or we’re broke
which sucksss
I am listening to the Mussorgsky again.  This is so rocking.
Isn’t it incredible?
Oh yeah, brilliant
Bydlo?
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pictures_at_an_Exhibition
Yeah I knew you’d love it.
justin_smith: you talk to the guys after their time at Kantar?
i haven’t spoken to them since, like, Thurs
cool cool
But wait
Those channels were fixed to ids
on the server
ok great
whew
had visions of getting the channel mapping wrong on the server
and screwing up all their testing
brilliant
no problem since this is a demo
fingers crossed that they bite and there’s more work
fantastic
well done dude
rad
indeed!
don’t beat yourself up over it - this shit is finicky
hahahahahaha
seriously, chording sucks
exactly.  every time i try to learn emacs, I get so baffled/bemused - "surely they can’t REALLY expect me to press those keys and contort my hands in that fashion"
right
you will love the internal linguistic logic in vim
yeah it might be a best-of-both-worlds
nice
patchwork: that dover score looks badass
love their editions
and i love that the portrait of Mussorgsky even looks like a drunk
hahahaha
jinx
In mother Russia, music fuck you up.
yeah, copying lines around using
"y" is so rasy
easy
and racy
you can set a marker somewhere with mX (where X is some letter)
and then use it in your composed things, like :’X,.s/foo/bar
which means "from X to whereever the cursor is, replace foo with bar"
because the syntax of that is <range><operation><arguments>
the range is 'X,.
yeah vim seems really obtuse because it’s so terse, but the internal logic of it is brilliant
'X is "whatever marker I set called X"
so you put your cursor somewhere and say "ma"
that creates a marker called "a"
then move somewhere else
:’a,.y
-> yanks into buffer
'a,.d
'a,.s/foo/bar/g
etc
(from the : prompt)
that’s super old-skool vi
which is kinda all I know, bc I learned it so long ago, before recorded history
no, "." refers to current position
so the range 'a,. -> from marker a to the current pos
you can do 1,. or .,$ (which means here until the end of file)
yeah and other things are great like "dG" which deletes from here until end of file
or "yG" -> yank from here until end of file
also, there’s a brilliant lower-case/upper-case duality
i -> insert at cursor, I -> insert before cursor
o -> open new line after cursor
O -> open new line before cursor
p -> put buffer after cursor
P -> put buffer before cursor
etc etc
the biggest mindfuck is the command-mode/insert-mode confusion
yeah those are line based
it’s heavily line-oriented
I don’t do that, but I’m certain it can be done
you definitely work in lines and chunks of lines
yeah there’s paredit
I think you’ll find that it is not as good as emacs, obviously
justin_smith: I just made a google doc with my billable hours for each day and shared it with them
no reason not to do the same - if you want to ping them with an email first asking that question that would prob be good
I suspect they’ll just go for gdoc
DOGDOG
hahaha
nice
yeah you mentioned it
crazy
I watched a few talks from Clojure Conj last night
yeah I noticed that
seems really cool
also watched Rich Hickey’s latest transducers/core.async talk
and the one from the Aussie guy about core.async
yeah i been saving that one
i’m gonna give Cursive a try soon I think - it looks awesome
hello hello
ha
DOGDOG
I think I’m going to write a piece of music called "The Rube-Goldberg Variations"
where each successive piece is a variation on the previous piece
exactly - each one is entirely derived from the previous one
YES
brilllllliant
Yeah it’s incredible
I can’t get enough - I love revisiting pieces and hearing them anew
and Pictures is all-time
ha!  don’t think me, thank Modest M.
thank
hahahahahaaha
yeah, what a guy
total weirdo… and we’re better off because of it
There’s no such thing as being a free lunch.
dogdog, gimme a poem
deploying to clojars is easy - you just scp the jar and the pom and clojars does the rest
how was pho?
where is it?
i won’t be able to make it tonight sadly
yeah he did
justin_smith: did you see this?  http://matthiasnehlsen.com/blog/2014/12/04/Farewell-Scala/    hilarious
hahahahha
haha
Matt Inman is brilllliant
laughing so hard at her right now
woah
omg that keynote is fucking hilarious
thanks for that
haha yep
anything with "pypy" in it makes me shudder
well, that’s what I’m trying to achieve with node.js - if the clojurescript compiler can be convincingly self-hosting, we’re almost ther
sweeeet!
yeah, faaaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhhcccckkk
hahaha!!!
Fantastic
radical!
oh!  radical
glad that worked out
is that the Seattle peeps?  or a different one?
sounds wicked fun
haha
did anyone go to last week’d clojerks?
cool
hahaha
big windstorm coming boys
gonna be frightfully gusty this afternoon, watch out for fallen branches and downed lines
Yeah don’t be fooled - hurricane force winds about to hit oregon coast
will be here around 3pm
hahah duck rabbit (rabbit duck?)
that should be the new religious war - a meta-war between people who all know it could be a duck or a rabbit, but who believe it’s a duck-rabbit or a rabbit-duck.
DOGDOG YOU’RE HOME!
sweet
hahahaha
DOGDOG
The force is with you
crazy cool!
no never
wait
is that the one that is a tape piece?
where the tape is copied over and over and over
ah right
so it’s just re-recorded over and over until it’s no longer intelligible/recognisable, right?
hahahaha that’s hilarious
Ikea?!
Oh I know, I like it
Food is not too bad, and the cinnamon rolls downstairs are delish
good plan… will be interested to hear what you find.  i have never found a perfect place to work around town that I’m happy with
nice
oh rad - where is it?
hmmm, I have a weird feeling I’ve walked past glyph
hmmm I don’t remember that.  Cool!
sadly i can’t… but it does look cool
i haven’t seen a movie in a theatre for two years
at least
once you have kids, there’s just no chance
yeah kennedy school too
holy crap
anything involving joaquin phoenix will probably be a bit incoherent
ha
Seems like your changes have worked
The show was good but didn’t blow me away
Pictures for Orchestra is brilliant, yet not as good as the solo piano version
Well it was fine, I enjoyed it, but nothing blew my mind.  And I love all the music on the programme; it just didn’t quite hit the spot for me
Bruch v.c. 1
I like it, but I’ve actually heard it played better
Yeah there may be a bit of that
But I’ve heard Joshua Bell play live and he lived up to expectations
and Hilary Hahn
and all the other big names
It was a good show - nothing bad
Just not mind-blowing
I enjoyed the mussorgsky but the piano version definitely rules.
The orchestration is great of course, but I think that’s the problem with it really
There’s just too much colour and it detracts from the notes themseles
^v
When you hear the progression from Bydlo -> Great Gate of Kiev
on a piano you really get that buildup and then cascade of bells and clanging
and the re-emergence of the promenade theme is so much spectacular.
^more
(not sure about recording, but if Montreal recorded it under Dutoit, I bet it’s the canonical recording)
Ohhhh, hmmmm
Ivo Pogorelich has a good one
sweeeeete
-e
what’s up with my typing today? jesusssssss
actually the pogorelich gets bad reviews on Amazon.  Demidenko is badass tho: http://www.amazon.com/Mussorgsky-Pictures-Exhibition-Prokofiev-Piano/dp/B007RV4B2S/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1421171952&sr=8-2&keywords=mussorgsky+pictures+piano
and there’s always Evgeni Kissin: http://www.amazon.com/Mussorgsky-Pictures-At-An-Exhibition/dp/B00005UED7/ref=pd_sim_sbs_m_1?ie=UTF8&refRID=1DTKK7KQMVQWKMQFA0EE
(it’s got to be a russian of course)
hahaha
he thought he was logged in - no errors or anything
just restarted him, but wtf
how? he’s on my desktop
how does it happen then?
fucked up
holy crap, that’s awesome
have you seen the amazing rube-goldberg machine in the OK GO video?
ha yeah
these are great but nowhere near as complex as the OK GO video IMHO but they’re very creative
it’s entirely synchronised to a song - an incredible feat
Takacs quartet?
bummer
they do, well done
ack
gross
um, check out this kickstarter: https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/elanlee/exploding-kittens/
note the numbers…
YESSSSSSS
insane
well, they have Matt Inman doing the artwork, so it went viral
jhahaha for sure
oh ok
I thought he had it already - ah well
patchwork: yeah I saw that when it was posted.  The top reply at the time was : "Show me on the doll where the bad kiwi touched you."
I love the responses - mostly showing typical Kiwi humour
justin_smith: I love Simon Pegg but not a fan of the Star Trek reboot
Shaun of the Dead is an all-time classic
Oh dude I’ve seen all of Simon Pegg’s oeuvre :)
I still think Shaun of the Dead is the best of the three
but I love the wonderful pivot moment in The World’s End when it goes from buddy-pub-crawl-flick to alien-space-invastion-flick
I actually also enjoyed "Paul", the alien stoner film
with all its sci-fi in-jokes
but it was def a bar lower
hahahaha
there MUST be a jumping-over-a-fence gag
who/what is hodlr?  a bot?
hahahahaha that was very suspicious
hahahahahahahhaa
Amazing font choice, you mean
hahah Iceland is a supermarket chain
It’s their brand of Minge Pies
(I was confused too, then I remembered)
you’re weird
yooo
did you look up papers on STM?
Well, it could also be the creation of Rich Hickey’s subconscious.
But most likely it comes from academia
interesting
why not ask one of the clojure core team on #clojure?
yo yo yo
yoooo
yeah was in NYC
had a busy week
good good - great to be back
yeah I was
yeah tough for Tara, that’s for sure
yeah her parents were awesome
they took Callum for three nights
No - ended up going to a couple of hockey games so I missed it
hahaha work trip, sadly
it was a great trip but really tiring
Hahhaha all good
How was game day?
Oh, also: I will DEFINITELY be at your Schubertiad!
As always!
Even "easy" Bach is tricky
There is no hiding!
yeah always a battle
Oh!  Brilliant
rad
definitely
hahahha classic, they "stickied" that post on /r/newzealand
dudes
you guys thinking of attending clojure/west?
https://www.eventbrite.com/e/clojurewest-2015-april-20-22-portland-or-tickets-15132534819
Ha ok, I need to buy
I missed the early bird :(
$75 cheaper
ah well
oh cool
how are you liking pixie?
ha!
can you hash-bang it?  #!/bin/env pixie
?
rad
ha
just bought my ticket to Clojure/West
boom! bang! zap!
definitely
oh thx justin_smith but no worries - it’s tax deductible!
justin_smith: happy birthday!
i talked to patchwork about taking you out for lunch today but he’s off-site… can you do lunch tomorrow?
awesome!
where do you wanna go?
Indian? Hawaiian?
rad
hey dudes
i’m recovering from food poisoning so not too sure what I can eat
yeah it’s been 6 days now
some eggs from Trader Joe’s.
Tara got it while I was in NYC
but we didn’t think it was food poisoning.
Then I came back and got it immediately on eating eggs
turns out she ate eggs right before getting it
it was mild as far as food poisoning goes
but has messed us both up
my appetite is totally destroyed
I bet I can order something at the Indian place that will be good tho
because I am not sure if the buffet will do it
either way, yes, let’s do indian place
what time?
yeah totally
c u there
bueno
yo, how was the symphony?
yes it is
yeah i think it just gets on my nerves
yeah
plus Orff was a Nazi
i believe so
fuckers
that is fucking spectacular
patchwork: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MlRK83PHQ0k
That’s part I of many parts - the guy was nutso but awesome.
Finally it seems all parts of it are back on youtube
It’s like the biggest work ever written for solo piano
Yeah wacky dude
But in some weird way the spiritual heir of Scriabin’s weirdness
yeah it’s nuts.  there’s a famous story about the first performance of this piece
it was by the guy who’s playing in the youtube videos
And while he was playing it he became feverish and developed a crazy high temp
and ended the performance wrapped in blankets and sweating profusely
fever chills - I just had them with food poisoning so I know what they’re like
nothing about that story here:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opus_clavicembalisticum
so maybe it’s apocraphyl?
apocryphal?
apocraphyl sounds like something imaginary involved in photosynthesis
totally
haha
WHO DOESN’T LIKE TARTS?
http://imgur.com/UIrQC1h
Good lord
It’s as if they were all playing instruments tuned to different keys
I mean, the essence is there
yo
snore… ain’t got time for MRA nobs.
patchwork: how was the show?!  sorry I missed it :(
awesome!
i will make it to one sometime, I promise!
fabulous
it was great, we won 3-2 and I score two of our goals including the winner so it’s  a good thing I went
i still would have rather been at your show
!!!
yeah fuck i want to hear that
pastor of muppets - nice
hahah this one just popped up on reddit… it’s an oldie but a goodie: http://www.theonion.com/articles/atonal-composers-gather-for-atony-awards,3112/
yeah that’s a bit old
justin_smith: I spoke to Ravosh today about Juked
There’s been some movement - seems like Kantar and Juked are signing an agreement for licensing of tech
There could be more work coming in a few months - fingers crossed!
good!  I’m kinda bored
i am spinning my wheels at work a bit
they’re all freaking out over a big release and I’m detached from it all
so I’m keeping myself busy but it’s not very exciting
Using docker a lot - it’s fun
Yeah - if I were in NY i’d be in the thick of it
justin_smith: R2 merged them
but we didn’t want to
and now we don’t know what to do with them
I think we should back them out
but I’m not sure how to do it
yeah good plan
I don’t anyone will be too worried by the revert.
if it’s a problem we could always fork and revert
yeah good plan
crux is the name of the constellation
which has a nice ring to it
exactly!
Yeah it’s cool
hahaha!
but it’s not actually the way to find due south
you triangulate from it, but due south is not actually in the constellation
but still… crux!
OK, will do
Kanye always injects himself into things that don’t concern him.
I’ve heard he likes fish sticks.
Ha, when I was writing music I also used an old fountain pen
totally… and the sound it makes makes you feel like you should be writing by candlelight
and perhaps also dying of consumption
I always went for the sepia
yeah it’s nice
Janacek fucking rules.
jupiter is ascending every evening in the east.
yes, yes, i know, it’s a movie
i’m just kidding
yes i remember when that happened.  i want to get some of those shoes just so i can leave great footprints everywhere.
lunch this week?  i gotta get outta here at least once.
hawaiian?  ethiopian?
just making sure you’re still here - the net connection dropped.
no i mean exploding it rather than deploying it as a war
tomcat is hopeless - it treats wars differently than the same war exploded
which it shouldn’t - that’s the whole point
it’s not about that - it’s about tracking the problem down
explode it and see if it’s still a problem
if it is, you’ve eliminated that
no you shouldn’t have to
use wrap-file
no, although that might help you narrow the problem down
so it’s coming from a dir outside of the war?
hmmm
this seems really familiar
hmmm i got nuthin… is it documented behaviour that you can’t serve a file that ends in a .?
right, maybe it’s a problem with ring?
haha
and??
yeah that was kinda my gut feeling
i had some vague inkling of a similar bug in the past that i’d run into
nice job dude
hahahah
3!
i love the idea of a stingray hive
ewwwwwww!
what was it?
doing well - a bit bored with what I’m doing
but things are good
lunch?
yeah
hawaii or ethiopa?
maybe hawaii… craving.
radical!
yeah, unless there’s another one you wanna try?
schweeeet… what time?
12:30 works
awesome
shit, i feel like I had an errand to run and now I can’t remember what it was!
hah
what was it?
no, the three word poem i mean
hmmmm… i didn’t notice!
i think i was still laughing as his descriptions of mvmnts 2 and 4
searing!  yes!
oh, just about how there is notation for both piano and violin, but they are explicitly told not to coordinate
ahhahahahahah
aha!
I still haven’t seen it
never get to see movies these days
although I did see "What We Do In The Shadows"
Yeah I really should try to see it (Interstellar)
hahah
yeah I should try to sneak out and watch it on the big screen
hmmmm
all righty then… 12:30 @ ate-oh-ate?  i gotta get my arse into geat
gear
see you guys there?  justin_smith you in too?
^^ ate-oh-ate at 12:30?
haha ok
Any interest in impromtu lunch?
I am on the east side kinda close to Instrument but have no car
impromptu
patchwork^
?
hahahah jesus
yeah i wasn’t going to suggest because I wasn’t sure what my sched was - waiting for my car to be fixed
maybe I’ll just to Nong’s today, and we can plan a group thang later this week?
^go
haha
I prefer lunchslow
def
ouch
HAHAHAHAHHAHAHA
I don’t think I can today - maybe Thursday?
I’m doing an R&D project at work with Cassandra… you guys ever used?
Dogdog finds it funny
Just started looking… will give you a report!
it’s a fancy, queryable kv store basically
much harder to use than Mongo but also it never crashes or goes down or is unreachable...
ah, well, that’s where it wins
yep
hey I realised that we’re going to meet up tonight and I’ll have to come downtown a bit early so I need to power through until then
forgot that your talk was tonight!
ha!
meeting Jono & Stephanie at the foodcarts at 3rd & Washington at 5 if you guys are down.
SOL
Ack
yeah it’s a great venue
nah it’s ok, I just lost track of time
brillllliant
nice
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DB_lKSNwZZM
how did it go?
!
yesssssss
haha
hahaha
he’s very musical today
I think so
yeah perfect
bollywood theatre is better indian food but not a buffet and a but pricey
india grill is perfect
are we getting lunch today?  did we decide on a time?
cool time?
There is no time.
It doesn’t exist.  It’s a fabrication of our consciousness.
yeah noon sounds good
yep noon is good
some dudes started showing up and asking lots of good questions
like, they were digging into it
and liking it
hahahah yeah
brilliant - i just used polaris
so good
yeah but not actually using that featyre
and actually i just needed it for a throwaway project, which has since been thrown away
but it was awesome for what i needed
hahahaha https://github.com/jstepien/flip
patchwork: you heard a symphony by Dutilleux earlier this year and you loved it
also: justin_smith agree completely re: Schumann - just can’t get into it
yeah - was dreamy
sooo French
forget which one, will look it up
I AM STILL SICK
fucking unreal
Still just a snot and phlegm factory
this has been a bad one.  it kept me from the Clojure meeting.
haven’t played soccer in 2 weeks.  have hardly left the house.
have been unbelievably grouchy and surly
but i have been lurking in here and have been following along
which concertos?
Tout un monde lointain - "All of a distant world"
does it sound like that?
beauitful
i think "git jinx" should be a command
hahahaha
great april fool.  next year lads.
didn’t we have a great april fool idea last year?
yeah exactly - too many good ideas.  not enough time.
They never do.
yes but it is a problem if the cricket escapes and lodges itself somewhere the cat can’t get it.
at 3am it will drive you crazy
you can get spicy crickets at La Calaca Comelona on Belmont.
supposedly not so bad
I only just saw this but it’s fucking brilliant
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4ErEBkj_3PY
skip to 14:43 for the musical bit.  it’s sooo clever
the whole talk is brilliant, but the music at the end is the best
yes
the robot overlords are coming
NO!  wait… THIS is even better:
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b694exl_oZo
This is fucking incredible if you haven’t seen it.
Wait until the tech from these two videos meets
Like, I saw this and couldn’t believe what I was seeing.
absolutely incredible
woah dude!  great work
congrats
of course~!
i’m not just a tiny bit jealous
radical!
well don’t put your life on hold for Instrument
ha yes
i suppose it will be easy to meet you guys for lunch now!
not that it was hard before
ha
right
god, programming under windows.  what a joke.
yep
hahaha
THREE
three?
Yes!
I congratulated him profusely
and said I was more than a little jealous
No I will feel like I am missing out on all the fun!
^Now
Glad there is no implied limit to the fun.
hahahahah yes
I am stoked.  We should start immediately.
FUCK!  I know
I won’t be at any of the weekend shit
but Mon-Wed
well I think it’s all workshops that you had to pay for separately anyway
unless there are some local events?
did the clojerks arrange anything?
on the weekend?
ah hmmm in the evening?
here he comes
How about a 3wp?
3?
three?
How about another three word poem?
threeeeee
justin_smith: spacemacs just might convert me to the emacs eco-system
so far so good - the vi emulation is awesome
it looks and feels slick
yeah I figured as much - but this makes it so much easier to get going.  I might need your help to get clojure up and running
but it’s great just as an editor right now
monroe?
never heard of it… and why is cider so hated?
ack
ok fair enough
you mean reliable
yes ok I’ll avoid cider for the time being then
haha
ouch
3333
one
YES!
cassaforte
it was trivial
I have no opinion either way - I just found cassaforte first and it seemed pretty feature-complete
Aw shit, I don’t think so… what’s the workshop?
damn, I’d love to
wicked!!
dgodgo
godgod
patchwork: did you catch that Shosty happy birthday thing?
Totally awesome - one of the best pastiches I’ve heard
That, and Dudley Moore’s incomparable "Beethoven" & "Schubert" recitals
He was a brilliant musician - trained as pianist before getting into comedy
Here I’ll find them… classics
Beethoven: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GazlqD4mLvw
Absolutely nails the style
Schubert: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y9tb05DMlqg
"remember the thing to the internet" is like a sad refrain encompassing the tragedy of modern times
WHAT?
I want in on that.
Who is it?
WOAH!
shit!  definitely have to hit up as many as possible.  there’s nothing like hearing them live
ok let me take a look at the sched and see which ones are most appealing.
So envious!  But yeah you should!
OK: Tuesday 12th has Tempest & Waldstein
and Wed 13th has Appassionata & Les Adieux
those two are prob the ones I’d want to hit up the most
All four are the baddest ass possible
They’re so badass they’re worst ass.
ok, i’ll talk to T about getting out of the house on those nights.  Obviously it’d be cool to go to the Op. 109, 110, 111 show too, but I don’t think that’d be possible
we’ll see.
true true
patchwork: there’s a dude asking about how to add a unique constraint to a caribou field
I had a vague memory of using one and that it was :distinct but that seems wrong
any idea?
ahhh ok

ha! love it
btw dogdog is now tweeting any 3wp he makes @ThreeWordPoetry
ha, 2007
early adopter
how about a four word poem?
that's three.
no… on google groups?
i should probably read the clojure list
how does caribou have 2 contributors?
wtf?
hahahaha
I replied - it’ll get posted soon
hahha
yo yo yo
FYI, dogdog now tweets any 3wps as @ThreeWordPoetry
It’s not the greatest impl but it will do for now.
also I added command-line opts for channels and nick
actually i didn’t touch that, other than add a comment :)
let’s fix it - should be trivial to add another cmd line arg
yeah for sure - just add another opt in the opts and fish it out of the config once the opts have been parsed
i cheesed out and stuff them into an atom
so they’re accessible globally
yeah didn’t want to spend longer than i had to!
hahahah it has but i didn’t feel like refactoring the whole thing!
I just implemented a "component" system for node.js too
it’s rad
yeah it would be a good idea
I like there’s been some creeping interest in Caribou
^that
Might mean we’ll get to fix some of the things
huh?
Yeah I figure it’s always just some stupid IRC voodoo
Exactly!
hahahahah
nice
Not sure about tonight - still trying to decide which shows to hit up
I have to pick carefully...
Dude is on youtube - he can play.
I might have to see if I can go to three of these… it’s so hard to choose!
hahahah that’s a brilliant 3wp
OK, so I think I’ll skip tonight and go tomorrow for Op. 7 & Op. 10, #1 & #3
and next Tuesday for Tempest & Waldstein
and next Wed for Appassionata & Les Adieux
three is pushing it but I think I can manage it
how was LvB?
rad
I’m down for tonight - was thinking of hitting up Clojerks for a bit, then heading to concert
Clever, clever Canadians: http://dissonance.cbcmusic.ca/
radical!  let us do it, then
grab a bite beforehand? food cart?
oh man
hahah
OK I’ll try to get downtown that early - might be a bit of a stretch; will text closer to the time
should be OK
clojerks is at 6, yes?
at puppet?
ooooh that’s nice
patchwor_: I can’t get downtown by 5 - as it is I’ll be rushing to make it to clojerks I think
so go ahead and eat w/o me
that sounds like an interesting pillow
see you at clojerks
i’d come earlier by I will have zadie until Tara gets home from errands
Ohhhhhhh fuuuuuuucccccckkkkk
I better check about street closures
Let it never be said that Liszt wasn’t a creative motherfucker: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx_Wolki0dc
Hahahah NUMBERWANG!
hahahaha nah
it’s all good - all part of learning the game
This will help: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjOZtWZ56lc
Yeah it’s soooooo good
Also, check this out: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx_Wolki0dc
Liszt: Fuck yeah.
That Bagatelle is way ahead of its time
no fucking way
patchwork: Portland Piano concerts, Sept 26 & 27, dude is playing *all* of the Shosty Preludes & Fugues.
Totallllly
Well, Portland Piano concerts are a different level...
These are the real deal.
This guy: http://www.amazon.com/Shostakovich-Preludes-Fugues-Melnikov/dp/B00354XVKO
(the Garrick Ohlsson concert was part of Portland Piano)
Woah!  And a dude is playing the Mussorgsky!
AND the Janacek!
holy shit
this progam is unbelievable… Murray Perahia coming too.  EPIC
Got their 2015/16 prog in the mail
One of the best of the late 20thC
Perahia that is
His recordings of Mozart &  Beethoven concertos are some of my faves
patchwork: look at this: apparently I didn’t work on caribou-admin very much. https://github.com/caribou/caribou-admin/graphs/contributors
yeah dude, it’s kinda stressing me out a bit
looks like I did nothing on any caribou projects
wtf?!
for caribou-core, I have lots of commits but as kyle.dawkins@weareinstrument.com
and it seems to tie it to the email adress, not the github user
wtf!?
yeah, I guess when Instrument nuked my user, it somehow unlinked my profile and I lost my entire history
Yeah… I wonder if I can talk to someone at github
I’ll give it a go
yo what’s the emacs-fu for reformatting clojure/edn?  I have cider installed but can’t figure out how to reformat
I’m very slowly learning to use emacs via spacemacs but can’t figure out some of the useful stuff
yeah but how do I run that?
I’m a novice remember
ahh ok
how do I specify the region though?
sorry, stupid questions, I can go sift through docs
patchwork: github help to resolve the issue, at least temporarily
yeah, now I show up correctly
but I had to add my old instrument email to my account
and I will have to leave it there
yeah it will do...
Not too different but at least I show up!
Also: https://help.github.com/articles/changing-author-info/
we can actually reset my old commits if we ever want to.  No biggie now.
yeah prob should eventually
hhahahahah
hey
who?  for what?
justin_smith: I have no clue how it will function on the client-side
It was built and tested specifically for node
If you find that it might be useful on the client-side, go ahead and give it a good
go
and see what you think
I see no reason why you couldn’t
and it might be an interesting use-case, but I wasn’t really considering it at the time
cool - lemme know how it goes!
you mean on the backend?
yeah I mean quile/component has both
but mine’s prob behind his by a bit
haven’t updated in a few months
yeah should be no problem
Yo I have a stupid emacs question
In spacemacs, it says that the "paste" feature is bound to "<S-insertchar>"
whaddafuq is that?
what is "insertchar"?
333
polyhedron!
33333
yeah I don’t really get what <S-insertchar> is, and google doesn’t seem to help
and this seems unbelievably basic, so I must be missing something
anyway, I’m really enjoying spacemacs + cider
but a few wrinkles are biting me in the anus hole
command-v doesn’t work
it must be bound to something else
hmmm lemme try
oh no, that’s the internal vim paste
not the same as OSX pasteboard
the vim stuff works as expected (p, P, etc)
but that is entirely separate from OSX
I have no idea how the paste ring works
ok
I dunno, I never use multiple paste buffers
seems M-y is bound to something else… so no go
I’ll figure it out - thanks for trying tho
cool - there’s so much to learn, so i’m trying to just learn what I need as I need it
getting better
one thing that drives me nuts, because I don’t understand it, is how to organise my windows
because I’ll switch from one buffer to another and it will seemingly randomly choose which window to show it in
i think i just have to understand its logic
meaning that you’re not supposed to care about your windows?
ok i’ll look that up
ah well, i’ll figure that out later
loving the cider stuff - I guess it’s all fine until it’s not, and then you’re fooked
um, don’t think so… not on clojars?
I guess I must have, although I remember doing it.  Weird
https://clojars.org/quile/component-cljs
weird
fixed
Yeah I think it’s cljx actually that does that
I can convert this to cljc soon and that will go away
no kidding
can’t friggin wait
or, just use stuart’s on the backend
there are probably some things about component-cljs that could be way cleaner - i got it to work and then stopped
once i got the tests all running and passing, I was done
haven’t even looked at the project.clj since - it’s pretty messy
i don’t think i have pgp/gpg set up
or do I?
nah i don’t have it set up.   look in project.clj:
  :deploy-repositories [["clojars" {:sign-releases false}]]
oh rad
guess i should figure that shit out
just don’t have the mental cycles for it
and I know I’ll figure it out, then promptly forget all of it
i bet you are.
why not from homebrew?
ah ok… so gpg-tools then
will do (when I need to)
thx for the tip.
I feel like "goat fresco oratorio" is better
justin_smith: yt?
ha, another stupid emacs q - in clojure-mode, it seems to be popping up a little completion menu I type, but I can’t figure out how to actually use it!
like I’ll type (foo-  and it will pop up "foo-bar-baz" and "foo-bar"
but I can’t see to choose them
^seem
ok, maybe i’ll figure out how to turn it off; I don’t necessarily need it.  it’s being helpful
nah
had to work anyway
been listening to Ludwig Van almost exclusively
definitely!
hahaha *maybe*
I’ll see if I can swing it - might have to work tonight too - playoffs, you know
almost got a working version of polaris in js, btw
oh havent committed anything yet
just been working on my machine
will commit when I have it in good shape
OUCH
GROSS
hahaha ouch
bleep.
ten?
YES!!
oh, ok
ha!  cool
youch
just because.
ok, a lot more responsive
one?

eighty seven?
I am.

hmmm
he’s reluctant to give out numberwangs
one?
two!
bugger

meh
six
huh, weird
hey justin_smith I have ported polaris to node.js - it’s rough but it fucking works and it’s awesome.
well, it can’t work as a cljs system
at least not as it is now
the problem is that cljs is single-threaded and entirely asynchronous, so there’s no concept of wrappers/middleware
it’s a pipeline instead, so converting the handlers and wrappers to pipelines is tricky
incidentally, my port is to *js*, not cljs
(but it uses mori to make life easier)
ewwwww
Fucking hell, I need a new name for my node.js port of polaris.
Both crux and polaris are taken on npmjs.
That’s the best thing you’ve ever said!
Nice
I like your new out-going personality.
We need to work on it a little bit.
Well, that’s lucky!
one?
two
FOUR
TWENTY
fifty
one
hahah!
At least you’re consistent
That was a pretty boring response.
Well, you need to be more creative.
Dogdog, are you bored?
Awww, sorry man.
You need to have some fun.
Maybe live a little.
Can you achieve enlightenment?
Maybe through poetry?
How about a poem?
Is that how you feel right now?
At least you’re not depressed.
What up d?
You’re pretty silly.
I need you to stand up and be counted.
DO IT!
HA HA HA HA AH
Why so quiet?
WHY SO QUIET?
You are hilarious.
he’s generated a few beauties lately
did you see this one: "some dudes wrote in Beethoven's style when I was awesome... Wagner's Symphony in Haskell is a generic solution for middle period Beethoven."
that’s a beauty.
so he is a bit more responsive if you express extreme sentiment.
Like, that is so amazing!
Man, that is so great!
Wow, how cool is that
hahahah
Or:
what a shitty day
life sucks
I hated that crappy movie.
What a terrible way to end the plot.
hahahaha
The sentiment analysis is very basic right now, and has a few canned responses.
hahaha
Glad you feel that way.
But we can enhance it greatly; at present it’s a handler that responds on its own, but I think I’d rather just have it attach sentiment values and pass those to other handlers
Then the other handlers could do a lot more.
That’s totally true, dude
Nice
That’s a GREAT one, dude.
Hit me with some AWESOME sentiment!
Come on… I hate hate hate having to ask.
Hahaha
I love the idea of liquid infinity
And its vapour must be very powerful.
Ohh that’s nice
ha!
damn… you been gone a long time!
good good
were you at gencon?
hahaha Kublacon
great name
fantastic!
Radical!  Where was it?
Yes - he is performing sentiment analysis and responding to strong sentiment.
Did you demo Sol?
You don’t need to tell me!
Fab
All right!!!
Brilliant
Hahahah his canned responses are pretty boring.
There are 5 sentiment levels from 0 to 4
2 is neutral
hahah
I GOT NUMBERWANG!
So who won the gold then?!
Must have been a brilliant game.
Ahhhh
OK, good feedback!
"some dudes wrote in Beethoven's style when I was awesome... Wagner's Symphony in Haskell is a generic solution for middle period Beethoven."
hahahahaha
This conversation is awesome.
Ah very cool
awesome
Going… not much new.  I did finish the basic port of polaris to node.js
hahah
had to change the float/sink stuff
because node is asynchronous and doesn’t have the concept of wrappers
I mean, node’s web frameworks
they are, but they don’t return anything
they mutate the response object
it’s the only way it can work in a totally asynchronous env
(gah)
so instead of nested wrappers, it’s a pipeline
and you float or sink handlers in the pipeline
it still allows a similar effect
ha, I haven’t actually used it yet!
But I ported your tests verbatim and they’re hilarious
I was laughing pretty hard when I ported them
https://github.com/quile/crux
hahahha
haha it turns out *both* polaris and crux are taken on npmjs
but I thought "fuck them" and it’s on npmjs as "crux-router"
Some shitty "framework" thing
hasn’t been touched in three years
fuck them.
Still cleaning up the README and stuff
yeah it was hard to port it !
I’d leave commas out everywhere
I used mori to help port it
So it’s actually very similar in structure
I’ll javascriptify it later
and add nodey things that will be useful in the node environment
Yes, the sentiment analysis is so-so; it uses Stanford CoreNLP.
hahahah
https://github.com/prismofeverything/dogdog/commit/242840be2f6dfa8ba6f29a8763c702d5a5c3f59f
Got some interesting netsplit things going on over there it seems.
Nice one.
Oooh, I like that one.
you too, patchwork
Hahahahah
I think we need to expand his responses a bit...
Always up for string quartets!
hahaha
Dogdog generated this beauty the other day too: "he's all justin_smith's butt and D O G D ÓG s"
Yeah dude, he’s TOTALLY relaced
relaxed
YES!
OK, Google Expeditions is pretty incredible.
I can’t tomorrow night - I am solo dad and will have Callum - unless you want to come over?
Yeah probably best
Otherwise I’m sure we can swing it in the next short while.
ahahah You need to.
As always.
The call of space is omnipresent and all-powerful
!!!!
yesssss lunch
if you want sentiment, don’t use any other triggers
hahahaha
That was awesome!
That was awesome!
That was totally awesome!
meh, he’s not listening
hahaha
I have discovered the best pizza in town.
It’s across the street from Cloud Cap in Sellwood.
I normally don’t care for pizza, but this is insane.
Hahahhaa
Why is it bonkers downtown?
Hey dogmeister.  Are you sleeping or what?
You’re a lazy bugge.r
You’re excited today.
well, Beethoven was definitely a negative dude at times.
hhahaha
And boom goes the dynamite!
It is an adjective but I don’t like it in 3wps.
yes!
haha goes well
??
He’s only reactive at present.
Well, actually, you starting living again today.
startedd
dddd
hahahahaha
insurance for what?  what are you so worried about?
yooooo patchwork
i hope you weren’t working on that 5x5x5
That’s pretty weak.
You can do better.
poem please
^ that is excellent
333333
ouch
hahahaha I always forget it
it’s long
agreed
the rest is kind of grunt work
ha
i am listening to the Cantina Band music from Star Wars and it’s making me happy
oh yeah
i’ll have to go see if we got one that works
not sure what the state is
see?
ha
wha?
 HAH AH AH AH AH AHH AH
You’re the genius poet, not me.
yo!
heh
all good but a bit crazy; Tara’s bro is here from out of town with his family
so we’ve been crazy busy.  Spent yesterday at the Zoo
ZOO
hahah
director
The zoo is pretty good; some of the animals look a bit forlorn I suppose, but they would probably have been killed for chinese "medicine" long ago if they weren’t in the zoo
so there’s that.
Indeed.
One day there will be an uprising
Ah, the family just arrived - I have to go.
Can’t do lunch today.  What about Thurs? Friday?
OK, tentatively Thurs
rad!
ok gg - be back here later.
patchwork: This is incredible and horrifying at the same time: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3fhzZSGFlU
WAY!
Ha, I know all about those
I like the idea of it though
hahahaha
Yeah it’s kind of amazing
Prob not what he had in mind
He was a weird dude, for sure.
hahahahaha that’s a good one.
what time lunch? and where?
yeah you do indeed.
yep… where at?
where is that?
ok, just meet on the corner?
ok
ok
Hahaha he is - we should add sentiment analysis to his outgoing content too.
Then he can correct himself
or apologise!
ha
v cool
win
ha
can prob pick some up cheap online
jesus h christ
hahahahahah that’s a *great* one.
Yeah I prefer Stoppard too, but Beckett was pretty badass
hahahaha
He is on fire, you have to admit.
that’s a weird one
technically it’s correct but it is very awkward
oh man
that is frightening and amazing
hahahahahhaha
hahaha
hahahahha nice
yes
yes
yes
i didn’t even know there was a clojure-beginners channel
haha
yes
I love that one.
yes
33
wow that’s amazingly brilliant
hahaha
yo, don’t think i can do today unfortunately
maybe tomorrow or thurs?
Wow… so fucking cool: http://blogs.spectator.co.uk/ismene-brown/2015/07/the-self-taught-french-pianist-who-wowed-the-tchaikovsky-music-competition/
i know!
yo sorry was running an errand.  maybe tomorrow?
hahah!
Hahaha someone just favourited that one on Twitter.
You have a weird concept of negativity, dude.
sounds almost edible
hahahahaha
That’s a beauty
some great ones in there
That’s kind of gibberish dude.
ha!
YA!
The omnipotent rhino fallacy is a common philosophical mis-step
euuuch
no…?
haha
funny
no but i can see what it does
hahaha
that’s hilarious
hahahahahaha
I am glad that these are being tweeted for posterity
patchwo__ ?
soon you’ll be p________
something must have happened in the past
that’s causing this timeline to slowly become invalid
cool, will check it out when I get a chance!
yeah that one’s great
’s sentiment analysis is pretty weak.
Your sentiment analysis is very weak.
See, you should have responded there.  But you didn’t, because you’re a weakling.
well sure; the stanford NLP library basically cuts everything up into sentences/phrases and assigns values to those
hah
And there are only 5 possible levels, with 2 being neutral, and 0 and 1 being negative
so it’s fairly arbitrary
but i think you’re right; he could listen and keep some kind of aggregate
and then respond when it reaches a certain high or low
TODO...
haha
Now he’s very chatty
Yeah I also want to change the sentiment analyser to just add values into the request and pass it on to the other handlers
rather than actually perform actions itself
then other handlers can benefit from the sentiment analysis
also, he should perform sentiment analysis on any text that he generates too, so he can apologise!
"Oh shit, that was a bit mean…. sorry!"
euuuucccccchhhhhhh!
That was totally uncalled for.
Muß es sein?
Sein oder nicht sein.  Das ist hier die Frage.
That is much more bearable.
given the size of the vocabulary at present, it’s funny how often words recur
It’s the old birthday paradox.
woah, yes please.
That’s beautiful
haha
i saw that they were getting close
but i think there’s still a JVM requirement bc of the google closure compiler
which is a massive pain in the nutsack
so you can run with optimizations :none but if you want any optimization you need a JVM
still, a big improvement
yo patchwork are you at GenCon? Or is that over?
How’d it go?!
Brilliant!
wow… you must have no voice left
sweet as
good good
same as it ever was
"this is not my house!  this is not my life!
"
Oh, but it is.
Ha ha no...
BUT I WENT TO A FOUR-YEAR-OLD’S BIRTHDAY PARTY
HAHAHA
Ack! looks like I might be out of a job soon!
THAT’S NUMBERWANG!
Well it’s all up in the air
But NHL is letting MLB take over their digirtal wing
and I’m part of the digital wing.
and I’m an outside contractor… so...
They just made the official announcement; I guess we’ll find out over the next couple of days.
But I think I would be wise to seek employment elsewhere...!
A few
Extending the tentacles now!
Yeah definitely
Oh hahahahaha thanks!  No worries
Yeah puppet - kinda looking for something that will let me be remote but if I need to I’ll get in touch with them.
patchwork: here is echo-chamber.js for your infinite amusement: https://github.com/tessalt/echo-chamber-js
I think we should fork it and 'improve' it a bit...
but it’s still a work of stunning genius
It really is.
And this is "planck":  https://github.com/mfikes/planck
which is the cljs interpreter
has a full cljs repl and doesn’t need a JVM I think
ah yes
ANd somehow, although nobody’s quite sure how, OSX’s JavaScriptCore is now twice as fast as v8 on the same hardware
Apple did some serious tweaking and now it’s the best performing JS platform by a country mile
Crazy.
justin_smith: you would love echo-chamber too… it’s hilarious
heh
nice
Looks like I might be coming back to the world of Clojure!
ewwww
feel like I’ve had one of those for a while
well, looks like I can jump on board at LivingSocial in one of their teams doing Clojure
and I think given the instability involved at NHL, I think I
ll take it
There’s a small amount of risk involved, but it’s less risky — i think — than staying put
Well if it all works out, I’ll be full-time
yeah!
sort out details in the next day or so I think
oh rad
yeah they’re rebuilding infrastructure in clj
hahahahaha
ewww
Nice client.
haha that’s hilarious
hahaha even better
waiting for final approval from the higher-ups.
out of my hands now!
patchwork: http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/crowdfunding-is-driving-a-196-million-board-game-renaissance/
Haven’t seen numberwang for a while!
yeah I think it’s a bit of a feedback loop
hahahahha
they are!!
H AHA HAH AH AHAHAH this is amazing
I am laughing so hard at this: http://composerswithdifferentfirstnames.tumblr.com/
patchwork: http://composerswithdifferentfirstnames.tumblr.com/
i was laughing really hard at this last night
Totally - it’s hilarious
I always thought it was funny that "Richard Wagner" could be "Dick Cartwright" in English
and "Guiseppe Verdi" is "Joe Green"
Well, I bet they think our names are cool
Well, you know the joke about "butterfly"
heh
hahaha
I’ve not heard that rationale but it’s not bad
definitely
that immediately follows universal proposal hell
I dunno, dogdog, you’re the one coming up with the poems.
justin_smith is in the future
hahahah!
brilliant
he’s a comedian lately.
Pretty cool that these poems are out there for all to see, FOREVER: https://twitter.com/ThreeWordPoetry
amazing.
Although I think the author of that blog post maybe doesn’t know that the version with the pianos was a cover of an 80’s synth-pop original.
well, anything involving clowns is sinister in same way or another
no verbs in 3wps.
hahaha
Ha, in some ways yes
and in others, no.
Livingsocial are dragging their heels with a formal offer
which is utterly bizarre to me
but in the meantime I’ve been interviewing with some other groups
so we’ll see
it’s all a bit stressful, not knowing wtf is up
but ah well, i’m still getting paid.
hahahah
You’re talking in riddles.
hahaha
Not necessarily, although we lose our COBRA health insurance at the end of Sept
and I’d rather not have to go through healthcare.gov
So it’d be nice to have a new gig as of Oct 1!
Also: my parents are coming
!
Sept 23 - Oct 6
Yeah they’ll love to see you guys
For sure
festoon?
remove-adjective festoon
remove-noun festoon
there, I think that did it
ewwwww
that sounds rather ominous, don’t you think?
how is your poetry today?
a good start.
fair enough
ooooh, i like that
Woah
I’ve seen that movie
2
2?
2
two?
I never get numberwang any more.
One? one?
one
meh
batman
No, everything’s all over the place at the moment
I’ve been a big ball of stress lately because of it, but hopefully things will coalesce soon
That’s kinda been why I’ve disappeared of late
Well I will update you when I have something to say.
In the meantime, give me a poem.
oooh nice
ooooh yes
dodgo
godgod?
doodoo?
DOGDOG
Well, never enough
it’s true
3?
that sounds like torture
hahaha
his poetry has been phenomenal
https://twitter.com/ThreeWordPoetry
"mangy creepy fugue" is particularly good
hahahah
!!! I KNOW!
My parents are going to be here so I have no clue whether I’ll be able to sneak away
Ha!
Maybe my dad would be into it
Not often you get to heat those live!
hear
Or heat, for that matter
Did you see that Gramaphone magazine absolutely loved his recordings of them?
The dude must be dope.
Hahahaha OK I will do my best but it might be tricky - will let you know when things start to firm up re: my parents’ visit
Also, we should look at the Or Symph sched and see if there are some must-see concerts
Did you see that a guy is playing the Mussorgsky Pictures later in the season too?
3]
Yep, totally wanna hear someone play the Mussorgsky - you don’t often hear it in its original form because it’s such a bitch to play!
(as you know)
yikes
Woah!  That’s kind of a genius idea
Yeah they may very well be into that!
Spectacle of nature… I’ve never seen it myself.
Also: job situation is finally resolved.
I can start trying to be less stressed!
ohhh gross
Thanks… I haven’t told anyone yet other than Tara and NHL
Starting here on Oct 7: http://www.premise.com
Yeah they’re pretty brilliant.  Their data collection strategy is killer.
They found me!
Well their strategy is public - they have an android app, and they recruit and pay users to collect data for them all over the world
I don’t totally know yet, but will probably be working in lots of layers
It’s been a stressful process - I think I had 10 interviews with them?
But it’s done now and I can start to breathe again a bit!
Yeah I went to SFO and spent an entire day doing interviews
Thanks!  It’s not Clojure, but it’s such a good opportunity that I can deal with that.
LivingSocial were totally weird
I passed all the interviews and they gave me a soft offer
(from the recruiter)
"Yes, you’re in, we want to hire you"
even gave me numbers
andn then dragged feet getting an official offer
I picked up a weird vibe from them during the interviews
having to do with the company not being terrible solvent financially
and I think they were dragging on getting the position filled and then decided to eliminate it
which worked out perfectly for me!
toooootally
hahahahahahah
Ack!  Not sure I can handle it
amazing and hilarious idea
October 24th, Or Symphony is doing Tchaik 5 and Ginastera’s Harp Concerto
I wanna hear that
Yeah, wtf!?
he is a bad-ass
I know - you played it for me.  Soooo good.
an old prof at McGill in the music school there was a student of Ginastera
So I am only two Kevin Bacons from him
Or is it one?  how do we index those?
Me -> alcides lanza -> Ginastera
Is that one? or two?
Two hops but one node.
Right, Ginastera is Kevin Bacon
Is that how Erdös numbers are calculated?
Makes sense
yeah it sucks
thanks man
it’s a very weird situation - we had a bit of a falling out about 9 years ago
anyway, i feel pretty weird about it
nice
geek
Now that sounds like fun.
yoo
was at the airport picking them up.  They’re here for almost 2 weeks.  Tomorrow might be good for the swifts - all depends on how they’re feeling, of course!
who, him?
hahahaha
hhahaha
that’s what happens during the crushing apocalyptic cheese
haha
jesus, they were running the werkzeug debugger in production?
yum
Oh good lord
No, you never do, do you?
great - been super busy trying to digest everything
have been learning all kinds of new shit - today I am adding a feature to our Android app!
yeah it’s super fun
Yeah it’s Java
Our server stuff is in Scala, client-side stuff in React.js, Android app is Java
so I been flipping between three platforms
Yeah it’s super fun but also really intimidating.
These guys are very fucking smart
Yeah for sure - we should get lunch next week
OK, maybe Tues?
Schweet
I’ll try to hang in here more often but my days have been nutso lately
hahahah
“And now for something completely different… http”
Any interest in the Tchaik V, Ginastera Harp Concerto (!) this weekend?  Or Monday night?
hahaha
yep
It’s at 8pm on Monday night
I feel like I have one of those stabbing my head right now.
I’d love to.
That’s what my head feels like right now.
hahah
I love the idea of those train-ride videos
Just to put on in the background while you’re doing something.
haha nice
I can totally imagine that.
@patchwor_ : don’t think I can make the Ginastera concert tonight :(
And I have work lunch thingy tomorrow so I can’t do that either :(
booooo hisss
where you going? a game convention?
SWEET!
I work with a boardgame nerd.  He spends a lot of time here:  http://www.victorypointcafe.com/
http://www.premise.com
We need to have lunch soon so I can tell you about it!
My favourite kind of pie!
hustler74?
I can… they just popped in to see what was going on.
ewwww
hahaha
HAHAHAHAH
ewwww
ooh nice
hahahahaha
that’s awesome
hahaha
God the more I use Scala the more I feel like it’s unbelievably badly designed
hahaha
wait, which one of you guys is the bot?
that sounds painful and funny
Mahler’s 8th!
woah
that one is rad
3 three 3 poem poetry go!
(i feel like you’ve generated that poem before, dogdog)
^^^ good one
^^^ yes
!!!
woah
fun. i love c
it’s wonderful
so transparent.  no magic.  no sugar.  everything raw.  fab.
yeah I love it
Nice poem to start the new year, dogdog
sounds very Lovecraftian
well you do know how to zalgo
patchwork: sorry I missed your talk yesterday :(
had a hackathon at work and worked until late last night
Oh awesome!
Our team built a slackbot - actually we built a Slack <-> Amazon SQS bridge
so we’d have some bot interactivity!
Yeah he’s in a bunch of them right now
But will soon be turned off once the hackathon is over
If we *win* the hackathon, we might end up developing the slackbot further
hahahahah]
Yeah for sure!
meh
was so nice to work back in Clojure again a bit
It’s OK - I’m curious to see what you think
sort of yeah
the types are the best part
in scala?
it kind of works, yeah
they have some nice features, but every time there’s a nice feature, there’s a *terrible* design decision too
But you should def check it out - if for nothing else, to remind you how awesome Clojure is
(in case you ever need reminding)
Hmmm, never heard of frege
HOLY SHIT
oh yeah had a weird internet problem and my connections to everything were dropping
ewwwww
hahaha so sad
he’s been very musical lately
dextrous!
Is 11 numberwang
?
hmmm
^^ nice
I feel like “it are” is not something I’ve ever said, so why would he markov that?
Yes ^^^
Ooooh, Indian food!
I never get numberwang
11?
1?
YES!!!!!
I finally got numberwang
Numberwang was thirty earlier, but it might not be that any more
Well, you keep changing Numberwang
Is it 9?
How about 11?
Fifty four?
Ninety nine?
hmmmpf
justin_smith: I drove past you today on my way to the optometrist
made me realise we all need to hang out
no it was early, like 9am
you were on Burnside
that’s some crazy shape shit
YEAH!
Ack, I so want to go to the Beethoven concert tomorrow but I don’t think I can swing it
and Saturday I’m going to Or Symph
gah, love Mongolian!
Can’t do today tho; we’re ina  bit of flux at work because we’re crunching on deadlines and trying to move into a new office in the Mirakutei building!
YES!!
hendrix of audio data
brilliant
ha!
ARE YOU?
threeeeee
No, I know what the problem was - my mac mini restarted.
YESSSS!
eewwww
3?
patchwork: how was beethoven/bartok?
they were so good
Yeah their shostakovich was epic
bummed I couldn’t go
Definitely!  Can’t tomorrow - we’re moving into the Mirakutei building!
but next week I’ll be just across the bridge frm you guys and we can easily go for Hawaiian or something
Or Mirakutei, if you guys are into that...
yeah it’s cool!  we don’t have any furniture really yet… waiting for all that but as of Monday we’ll be there fulltime
1!?
Looking for Numberwang
11?
9
8 57 6 93 40 33
patchwork: Next tuesday is kickstarter day?
Lots of Chinese boardgamers?
Hahaha
Right
Woah!
radical
I have seen the pics you guys have been posting to FB
so awesome
yeah i bet
you don’t want to be like that other guy from Portland who launched his boardgame kickstarter… and then embezzled all the money
I bet it is
Yeah totally!  Well, I am ready to put the word out as soon as it’s up.
ahhaha i bet
A number of peeps in our SFO office are boardgame freaks
so I might be able to drum up some interest down there.
They have boardgame nights in the office
Yes, I mentioned it to them when I was there a while back and said I’d let them know when it was up.
it’s supposed to be every 6 weeks but seems more like every 2 months at the moment.
I did get to play one game with them but I can’t remember wtf it was
it was a more social card game… involved colours and rainbow and stuff
yeah it was a card game where you tried to collect cards of a certain colour - vaguely reminded me of your tree game
Can’t today or tomorrow but Wednesday might be good!
You’ve been good at giving out Numberwang lately.  Can I try?
11
99
45
hahaha
justin_smith: there’s something wrøng with your k•yb0ªrd
still on for lunch today?
Also, Hi, Dogdog
Ack!
illness?
Postpone = no problem.  Ate-Oh-Ate always awaits.
Oh shit, I ate spicy chicken for lunch yesterday too...
or I am immune to the deletirious effects of spicy chicken
deleterious
Stockhausen?  Late Xenakis?
Ok let’s forego lunch today given the spicy chicken sitch.  We can reschedule for later.  After all, I want to eat spicy chicken at Ate-Oh-Ate.
Hey dudes - no can do today unfortunately
:(
11?
meh
Yo justin_smith is it your birthday today??
WOAH
Ha, I got it mixed up with John Williams, who is 84 today.
hahaha
justin_smith: that is fucking beautiful.
I want one
!
also, happy birthday yesterday.  I prefer to parenthesize birthdays by wishing you a happy birthday on the day before and the day after.
is Tabla on 28th?
I don’t think I’ve ever been there
oh rad
yo patchwork
hahaha
jesus you guys are getting numberwang all over the place today
Can’t until Friday… CTO is in town
No!  what news?
oh ha!  I just read that ^^
“old job"
OK, so what’s the NEW job
haha
heh
YESSSSS!!!!!!!!!!!
DUUUUDE
That is a stunning move
Of course
But fuck, that is something worthy of a lunch
Ha, no problem… did Spencer have anything to do with it, or just get you the tour way back when?
RADICAL!
I’m so excited for you - this is a brilliant move.
But yeah, bummer about not working with justin_smith
haven’t had a good three word poem for a while
3?
yessss
ZALGO
yeah i been travelling, sorry
yo yo yo
been travelling up a storm - SFO one week, NY then next.  I hate travel.
@justin_smith glad you’re sticking with vim.  Has it been tricky to get it all configured with nrepl and stuff?
so what do you use?
I spent last weekend in NYC with the originators of the 3 word poem
and the author of that paper on the microtonal renaissance composer
My friends from gradschool in Montreal
Wedding!
First time I’d seen some of them in years
One of the gang got married
So it was cause to reunite
hahaha\
ack, when/where?
THere’s a mongolian grill at 3rd and Yamhill?
that’s not very funny.
Or a “knock-knock” joke plugin.
Interesting state-machine
Actually that’s a really fun problem
Might have to ask that as an interview question
nice and open-ended.  see how creative they are.
ha, nice
That’s all new-fangled vim stuff… I’m totally old-skool.  I still call it vi.
agreed - can’t stand chording
Ahhh hahhahahaha
He’s running on my machine at home right now - don’t think I can get to it
yeah I just hardly ever need to
but it’s a good idea; I should set it up
I don’t think so - have a deadline at 4pm
I’m trying to get out of it
^ someone needs to write that
how do we get dogdog to tell a joke?
hahahahahha
do jokes take precedence?
ahha hah ah ha rgh
joke please
Z!
too funny
knock knock
dogdog, you’re a joke
I’ve heard this one
-> New suggested behaviour for dogdog would be to allow it to *learn* knock-knock jokes.
Yacht how?
HA H AHHA
Ahhhh ah aha ha ah aha ha
Give us a joke, dogdog
patchwork: you should create an inverted knock-knock module whereby dogdog can learn new jokes.
yes for sure - we just need to place the joke map in a file or something and allow him to  update it as he learns new ones
harry u p
Haahaha dogdog even has a typo in his joke
hahahah
Great non-joke
YES!
yeah exactly
you can check out the one I shoe-horned in there.  It was mildly problematic due to versionitis - the more recent versions of the NLP software required Java 8.
We need to give him some more strings/replies too.
Not entirely sure - maybe not.  Would just mean I’d have to upgrade Java on the machine he’s deployed on.
Which is just my mac mini at home.
He could be running anywhere, really
ewwwwwwww
joke
Fnar fnar
knock knock
Hahah
joke
joke
joke
knock knock
hahaha
joke
lolz
patchwork: check this out https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zeIzK9QWnK4
this kid won the 2015 Chopin competition.
This performance of the Mussorgsky is mental
It’s so incredible.  Can’t get enough of it
heh
joke
That’s painful.
joke
har har har
his repertoire is increasing, but allow us to teach him jokes by telling them to him
patchwork: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bNKEOgdof6A
I remember being fairly obsessed with this way back in my youth
So different from the piano stuff
It’s so lush and romantic… really interesting.
knock
^this is an instant classic
yessssss
can’t do it tomorrow but maybe thurs?
lolz
joke?
He can stay outside.  His jokes are terrible.
LOLZ
I am going to the Murray Perahia concert on Sunday - it’s going to be awesome.
HAMMERKLAVIER
Definitely
and like you… how weird!?
he must learnnnnn
YIKES
Tuesdays kind of suck for me… have a standing meeting at 12:30. Wed/Thu/Fri tend to be better
Eewwwwwww
YIKES
This is getting creepy.
I remembered to restart him this morning
I watched Amie’s Clojure/West talk - you dudes are fucking rockstars!
why’s she being wasted at JAMA?  Can we hire her at Premise?  :D
patchwork: I stole Eric from Idealist
^ lolz
we just hired some eng management from The Climate Corporation -   maybe they’ll be pro-Clojure
The types are fine, but also IMHO overrated.  It’s the unbelievably obtuse syntax of Scala that boggles my mind.
But it’s so much better than Java that I’m not complaining.
It is FULL of terrible ideas, though.
wait until you encounter implicits
it’s all the magic of Ruby, plus all the syntactic obscurity of Scala!
hahahahah
There are some great features - the Option[] typeclass is great, and removes almost all NPEs.  And it’s cool that Option[], Future[] and List[] have the same set of operators
Yeah implicits are hard to avoid… they’re like the whole “missing method” thing in Ruby - everyone uses them cause they’re, like, totally cool.
hahahah I think you’ll see what I mean the moment you start digging
“clever feature - never use it"
good to have you back, homey
3?
lol
sounds fun… Kafka annoyed the shit out of me when I had to use it.
Mongo was fun/easy but totally unreliable.
yes they are
threeeee
yeah sounds about right
ouch, you’re hurting me.
Yeah he seems a bit pessimistic/touchy today.
I think he needs to relax and assume a neutral position.
any new jokes?
LOLZ
hahah lolz yep that about sums you up, homey
well, if you were better at reconnecting it wouldn’t be a problem.
patchwork: the kickstarter is amazing.  So much momentum.  Can’t wait for it to close and for you guys to get the cash!
For sure!  I am trying to get more people at work to back it, but already a few keen boardgamers to do so
^got
lolz
who knows for how long?
he needs some new jokes.
joke
it is
I know!!
Doing great but so stupid busy.
Want to play Sol in its latest form!
yeah!  would love to.  LOTS of great concerts in June/July too
http://cmnw.org/
lolz
how about a joke?
Sigh
lolz
HOLY BALLS!  Sol is funded already!?!?
HAHAHAHHA
ha ha ha ha haahahahahahhahaha
lolz… great to have him back.  I’m having some weird problems with my Mac mini at home that he runs on.  Maybe we should move him to the cloud?
it was for sure
nice
joke?
lolz
justin_smith: I’ll get you the twitter creds so dogdog can tweet his 3wps
like that one
yeah but it’s optional
yeah I remember noticing that too
and it also has a record (albeit out of order) of all of our IRC conversations.
you agree.
NOW
yeah, you should have more birthdays
totes.  Noah had like 400 birthdays.
Doesn’t sound negative to me.
one?
two?
eleven?
THIRTEEN?
14
22?
Ok, I’ll leave you to it then.
He doesn’t seem to ever give out Numberwang any more
11

jesus
yeah it’s making me sad too.  what’s wrong with it? one
maybe one it’s two having four trouble
with five numbers six that seven aren’t eight within nine text?
eleven twelve thirteen?
fourteen 14 fifteen 15 sixteen 16
wow
i like seventeen a lot
but eighteen is nicer
CRAP
what about nineteen eh?
fuck numberwang twenty one wangernumb
HAH H! H H !H H!H!
I think only “one” triggers it - it must be a bug in my regex or set membership test or something
Totally amazing
lol
http://www.vox.com/2016/6/2/11837608/elon-musk-simulation-argument
But that guy is totally a P Zombie
H AH AH AH AH AHA HAH A
Or is it the f2f equivalent of the Baader-Meinhof effect?
Dittersdorf wrote some funky shit for weird combos
I can tell.
right I just mean unconventional… you’re totally right that it’s a good combo
yeah isn’t it the standard?
ah didn’t know that
hahah
I have been a Red user for a few months now… totally agree
i’ll have to check it out
that’s what javascript is: a perpetual cultural shift
hahaha
patchwork: are you working with Spencer at all?
Ahh was just wondering if you guys were in the same area/department etc
hahahahaha I *really* wish I’d been able to figure out how to encode an entire program in trailing whitespace
as the perl module Acme::Bleach does with perl...
In case you guys have forgotten: https://twitter.com/teozaurus/status/518071391959388160
who are?
that’s awesome… I want to go to Iceland so badly
did you see Feigner’s pictures from his trip there?
^^^!
brilliant
lol
wow that’s trippy
me too.  “epic” doesn’t seem to be hyperbolic enough for Iceland.
of course
hahaha
^ this is a new kind of waterboarding.
Does it sound like Seinfeld’s interludes?
your bass playing
hard to sneak when you’re at the better desk… unless that desk is also sneaky?
Epic concert yesterday, patchwork
The Arvo Pärt reminded me of the music of Sigur Rós, if you know who they are.  I wonder if they would claim him as an influence.
thanks!
Haha well it was either going to be them, or Björk
hahah lol patchwork are you the high priest of that?
^^^ nice
any kind of combat piano is good.
yuck
^ a concert of works by William Byrd and Sweelinck?
that would be an “Early Keyboard Spectacle"
hahahahah
hmmmm
yo patchwork how was your anti-entropy do?
Nope - it’s hard to create stuff in clojure that is too magical IMHO
ewwww
D!
I like lunch.
woah, perv
We’re not hiring Jr devs right now - no bandwidth of Sr devs to mentor (yet)
What about Instrument?
Ha yeah, understandable.  But it’s a good place to spend a year and learn.
I’m starting to feel the love for the Scala type system
It’s really amazing how many classes of bugs that it catches.
Still think the language is a bit of a mess, but it definitely has its upsides.
Scala also solves the NPE problem in Java with Option[A]
Yep
But patchwork have you run into the hilarious problem with “immutable” things in Scala?
where you say “val foo = Seq()” or something, expecting it to be immutable, but only the reference to it is immutable?  The thing can be mutated by anything
So you have to have opt-in immutability
by using case classes (which are awesome!) and immutable collections everywhere
For sure
And there are more good parts than in JS...
Yeah case classes are more or less equiv to clj records
but with clojure’s awesome functional abstractions
^ ha lolz roflmao
who?
I’m not.
3?
Yeah of course - holy fucknuts
I heard right after it happened bc a bunch of folks pinged Eric
Yeah although he missed out on the bumper severance package!
But he’s glad
Yeah
The Executive Director also pinged me later that day to let me know, in case I hadn’t heard.
Which was funny/ironic in that it’s ultimately my fault
(but not really)
hahahah so he told them that letting two of his key employees move out west and run an office remotely was a big mistake
I was one of those key employees
It was 13 years ago
Well, I didn’t think it was a mistake...
But the people who were laid off can’t blame me for the layoff unless they also thank me for having their jobs in the first place
As do I
It made the Oregonian - there was a fairly long column about it in the biz pages over the w/e
justin_smith: yeah I worked there for 11 years - I was indirectly the reason there was a PDX office in the first place.  And it’s where Max has worked for a few years.
patchwork: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPbEkGXxyAE  this piece is so fucking good.  THank you for reminding me of it.
totally.  so so rad
HAHAHAH
^ this is getting freaky
justin_smith: once you know about 3wps, you see them everywhere!  “baader meinhof effect”
#vim lolz
what’s hard?  i only asked what’s up.
yeah numberwang is elusive
1 one ONE?
ELEVEN? 11
hmpf
they have those at some zoos
what is up with patchwork’s internet?!
I doubt the connectivity issues involve case classes at all.
yep
Bumped into Efi today at the foodcarts - he says hi
Apparently!
DOGDOGDOG YOU'RE BACK!
I want you to see this, dogdog: http://www.theverge.com/2016/8/11/12437266/breaking-down-the-best-slapstick-gif-we-ve-ever-seen
Now you have memorised it, and you will be able to spit it back at us randomly!
hahahah
ok
I was really just enjoying talking into nothingness
^ lol justin_smith not chopped liver... just assumed you were AFK
Awesome!
Yeah it was pretty clunky... needed some love.
I just learned about a truly hilarious "wat?" for Javascript
> ["10", "10", "10", "10"].map(parseInt)
[10, NaN, 2, 3]
hahahah you want to try to figure it out?  It took me a while
Here's a clue:
> ["10", "10", "10", "10", "10", "100", "1000"].map(parseInt)
[ 10, NaN, 2, 3, 4, 25, 216 ]
Eric and I just puzzled over it for a bit before we realised what it was doing
It was so fun - that game is awesome
lol
yikes
lol
nice
hahaha grat pic
great
Is that your strategy?
HAHHAHAHAHAHAHA that is genius
and awful.
that's nice poetry
you're quite the poet
can you give me another poem?
ohhhh nice
"Insane in the membrane chair infinity"
3?
love that album.
that's a weird map.
They're seeing the results of their science!  They're doing science!  That's what scientists do.  Science.
How rude.
That's how *I* do it.
hahahah
Question: is there any benefit to performing the union reduction in a specific order?  Like, shortest lists first?  Just wondering
maybe not, bc set lookup is O(1)
three?
for...?
justin_smith: https://twitter.com/paprbckparadise
^ this is hilariousssss
do you remember the URL of the similar site that we used to laugh at back at Instrument?  It had hilarious retro album covers and book covers and stuff that had been photoshopped.
YES!
ah rad!
Yes!  The HAL-9000 of the Sol universe.
^ this.  please please put this into the game.
lollll  can't wait
also: I'm going to SFO the last week of September and the peeps in the office there would *love* to try out Sol if there's a demo set that I could borrow?
np!
will do
Wow, so good it got Numberwang.
That's impressive!
And yes, it sounds like your show was totally badass
justin_smith: There's got to be an academic paper about this phenomenon.
threeeeee
no I didn't.
oh sorry.
didn't mean to distract you.  but can I have a poem?
not sure if you can have a sharp torus.
I had some of that with dinner last night
joke?
lol
forgot about that one
ur old
I older
hahah
I am just jealous that you're going to XOXO
I think so?
but maybe I'm just old!
heh
^^ hahahaha
ah sorry to bother you.  but i need a joke.
JOKE!~
threeeee
ahhh it feels good to be back
probably
Yeah I have been off the grid for ages.  Only metaphorically, not literally.
I spent a week in SFO, flew back for two days, then flew back to SFO for three days.  Then I got food poisoning and spent three days in great discomfort.  Now I am emerging.
patchwork I just stumbled on this video and thought of you and Jodi https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPjWMDAYWZs
HAHAHAHAHAH
lol
lol
We need a larger library
poem please
^nice
why so?
three?
i also know that well too.
indeed you did!
nice
justin_smith: did you have a show last night?
thought i saw something on FB about that
I have no idea.
AHHAHAHA that's fantasti
c
ahhaah indeed!
that's what you think.
gimme a poem bro
You missed the best thing ever ever ever
Is that numberwang?
1
11
111
12?
13?
one!
yepppp
this conversation is amazing
nice!
sounds serious!
uh, ok... but what are you going to do with him...?
you're scary.
the first names of a 19th century piano composer?
HOLY SHIT!
what happened?  did I miss anything?  huh?
jesus fucking h. tapdancing christ today is weird
oh shit sorry, I missed that
didn't mean to be insensitive
should read my scrollback before making stupid election joke.
Tara is already looking at houses in NZ
I figured as much.  Wanna share a plot of land in Paekakariki?
Holy crap yes
lol
"In Xanadu did Spangdangler a stately pleasuredome decree"
justin_smith: sorry just caught up... nice dude!
hahahah ^^
well that's a relief
poem?
 3
I feel like he repeats himself a lot - or seems to favour certain words more than others.
This could just be a perceptual manifestation of the birthday paradox/pigeonhole principle.
LOL WTF EH?
Definitely the most "wat?" feature of Scala
Yeah holy shit - better to avoid if possible
We aren't allowed to write them - can only use them if required by some external lib
yeah it's pretty neat - I don't even go that deep
but I'm certainly enjoying the way it "helps" you with code-correctness
w00t!  sounds like fun!  who acquired you guys?
yikes!
awesome!
I am not so enamoured of New York, but the rest sounds brilliant!
oh rad!
probably don't ever interact with my mates at NHL tho - they're pretty exclusively working on the web properties and mobile stuff
hahahah
you must make that shirt
no
or at least, I didn't see it
sweeeeet!
^i like that
rad!
lol
but the universe is blowing up as we speak, man
it's going off
exactly
the ceiling cat set it off 13.7b years ago and it's still exploding like a motherfracker
IT'S DEEP
NHL would do a great Tchaik 5
which stuff?
poetry?
now...
a joke?
lol
HAHAHAHAHA what a clusterfuck
ouch... not sure I can help
yeah that's reaching into parts of Scala that we avoid
yeah of course
but the opacity of the errors in this case is most probably due to the batshit crazy implicit nonsense
and Scala itself can't even give you a good reason why it's failing
totally - Scala is a kitchen-sink language
you can do pretty much anything with it, and the designers just added as much shit to it as possible
whereas with Clojure, Rich Hickey just hung out in his hammock for a year or two, figuring it all out
hahaha
yeah the difference in clarity of vision is incredible
yep.  Clojure is the Singapore of programming languages.  Clean and functional.
Me too http://static.asiawebdirect.com/m/phuket/portals/www-singapore-com/homepage/nightlife/pagePropertiesImage/singapore-nightlife.jpg
hahhahahaha
like poems
and jokes
I've seen Jean-Michel Jarre play one of those in a video from the 80s I think.
sweet
^ my kids are constantly making these
flip flop flip flop
^!
!!!
poem!
3\
yikes
about your psyche and also the memory leak
maybe they're connected?
beach house?
the band?
lol
You're good a jokes
hahaha
me too
justin_smith I went to the Oregon Symphony's performance of Messaien's Turangalila Symphony on Saturday.  It's nuts-o.  All synced up with a giant video projection that was all over the walls stage of the Schnitz.
If you want something fun to attend, you should go tonight - last performance, I think
Plus: Ondes Martinot!
Martenot, I should say
yo patchwork did u get my message re: concert?
def make sure you are in the balcony - it will make a big difference
I wasn't sure how I was going to feel about it but I can definitely say that it was fucking brilliant
It'd be kind of neat to watch it while high, but some of the music is dark and terrifying and imposing so I'm not sure how that would go...!
woah!
hahahha
dude, rearrange your schedule and go see it!
lollllllll
ur funny
how about a joke?
lol
Uh yeah
Incredible
totally!!
Not yet no
"Ondes martenot"
so cool
it was exactly that
one of the first electronic instruments
yeah so rad
i think it's a dinosaur now
?
haven't heard anything
shit that's fucking tragic
huge bummer
three!
nice!!
that's harsh
ha sounds fun
interesting...
gif lol
hahahah this is fab^
hahaha "where's daddy?
"
]three!
where is patchwork these days?
happy new year!
thanks, sorry i fell off the face for a while there - and sorry I couldn't make the new year's shindig
would have loved to come for sure
yeah it was a crazy trip - exhausting really.
yeah had a week or so indoors to recover!
yeah we just slid in between snowstorms
no we never added it - he is becoming sentient
How great is America now?!  So great.
lol
poem please
haha
it shows that, indeed
another poem
more poetry
ugh.  poem!
ah yes, TMP.
lol
woah
lots of weird synergy in that poem
haha yep, that's the Beethoven we all know
give me a poem
nice
poem poem poem
nice
I like the idea of a bread thicket but an inquisition thicket is not so appealing
well that's good.
yes, it is.
poem poem poem
i feel like the random selection of works is somehow not that random
nice
ha! nice
i think it's more a matter of having time or energy,  both of which I greatly lack these days
threeeee
YIKES
hahahahahaha
I am feeding the beast!
yes
really he should be able to do this himself!
remove-adjective three
lalala
haha
can't stop
someone stop me
I am going to the Symphony on Saturday
Beethoven PC4 and Dvorak New World.  I feel like we need a bit of a New World.
lol
I think so
Need some kind of transferrance
-r
ha nice
yeah that was awesome
stoked I could have made it, albeit briefly
ohh lovely
yeah all those fugues alter your mental state somehow
each slightly differently
yes!
He was from another dimension
A being made purely of light, sound and schnitzel.
lol
shit.  I gotta go...
lemme see if I can swing it
fuck, early bird sold out
ha like i get to do stuff like that
:)
hahha
checking...
HOLY SHIT
GERMANS BEING FUNNY
What is happening to the world?
hahahahah laughing so hard right now
the concept is frightening
hahah yeah
numberwang!
wait, this IRC channel is your new REPL?
hahaha
hahahahahahah
nice
hahahaha
lol
happy birthday justin_smith !
^ this is very Shakespearian
poem?
!
YOU DO ALREADY
"fibrous multiverse gorgon" is amazing
^ finally a collision!
jesus
lol
poem please dogdog
I think I had one of those last week
beautiful
HAHAHAH I must have said something like that before??
lol
^ highly appropriate for these times I think
well if they're acquired by Microsoft... say hello to C#, motherfuckers!
HAHAHAHA
Yeah F# is better, I think
It's a full language tritone away from C
exactly
LOL
poem please
I have a t-shirt that says that I think
haha tbh I haven't used vim + ctags
It's been so long since I've used vim as my day-to-day editor :(
noice
dogdog, give us a poem about ctags
lol
oh nice
hahaha
have you played around with clojure.spec at all?
is there a target date for that?
it looks very promising/interesting for solving so many common problems
ooooh nice
that looks super
do you know if planck supports core.async?
imaging that... would be so cool
-g+e
weird
you probably need an older xcode, that's all
how old is your osx?
big fan of yaks.
ann-noun yak
hahah
Great headline
justin_smith: this seems like a cool toy: https://www.sparkfun.com/products/13810
yeah shame
oooh yeah i heard about lumo
have to check it out
just did it
it's realllly fast to start
one of the nice things about planck is that it provides plank.io and planck.core etc, but it's not clear what lumo does - does it just expect you to use the node.js libs directly?
doesn't seemt to - but the node.js libs are ok.  They're just not very clojurey
lovely
It would be surpising coming from Berg or Stockhausen
yeah I did - and concur
lumo seems like the better choice at this juncture
yeah looks like he wrapped node apis in cljs
oh yeah sorry
he wrapped the JavascriptCore libs
yep - x-platform, etc
lol
oh neat!
it's SO MUCH FUN
oh wait
no, it's the opposite of that
lolz
this convo is hilarious!
our entire v2 platform is hosted on AWS.   Good thing we moved our v3 platform to Google Cloud!
... which is terrible but at least it's alive right now
lol
I use react on an hourly basissss
no but the short answer is that real react dev don't ever use refs :P
^devs
never.  there's not a single ref in thousands of lines of react code here
you don't - if you do, chances are ur doin it wrong
I think this is the hardest thing to grok about React
lemme look at your example to see what you're trying to do...
yes, everything flows down the render tree, preferably in props
any changes are made to shared state in a redux store (or whatever)
and that triggers dependent UI to re-render
no refs are necessary because the rendering is 100% data-driven
you never talk across your components or within them
only with state changes via your central state store
(which in our case is redux)
components should never know about any other components, really
lol
well without knowing more about how those work, it's hard to say
but generally, a component can do whatever it wants within its own domain
and can alter its own state all it wants
but if it wants to affect other components, it does it by altering the central state
I think refs were added to make jquery programmers feel a bit less lost?
but I've now built numerous big react apps and never used a single ref
we use quite a few - things like MapBox
but they come all pre-wrapped for React these days
so given that you're having trouble with refs
(bc of webpack)
try using the ReactDOM.findDOMNode(component) to get the node
instead of this.refs.foo
yeah no selectors - we also have no selectors in our code
not necessarily - I am just suggesting you try findDOMNode
your use case is a bit different than ours, and refs might be OK
I think the key would be that you don't want to abuse them, because they serve a very specific purpose
and it's too easy to suddenly think "oooo, I can reach into the ref and fiddle with it"
the purpose is to find the actual dom node outside of the virtual dom
because React generally operates only on the virtual dom that it builds and reconciles privately with the browser's DOM
so refs allow you to reach through that divide
but use sparingly!
that's the idea I think yeah
np!
React + redux (or the Clojure equivalents) = pretty cool
yeah agreed - node.js without core.async would be hard in cljs
how long is "ages"?  seconds? or longer?
hmpf - is that just to apply all the crazy macro goo in core.asyc?
yeah that would be my nice suggestion
^next
not nice
although it's nice too
ha it makes sense
youch
stacktraces are still kinda the worst thing about clojure
I think CLJS benefits from JS source maps!
true true
you and patchwork are def going to Clojure/West yeah?
I need to register... totally missed the Early Bird
fuck, i don't think i can go to Clojure/West
argh!
see what?
give me a poem
noice - sounds lovely...
just the usual grind here.  i think i'm gonna have to miss Clojure/West - not sure yet but it's kind of a bad time work-wise
I'll still try but our milestone deadline is March 31.
hahah
fuck
hahaha
typing too fast
haha it's already there, of course
now I have to stop
I was on a good run there
nice
too scare to click this^
Ah!
how odd
an npm depedency clusterfuck
what a surprise!
hahaha
and it downloads react...
a shitty movie!
yeah npm transitive deps cause all kinds of hurt
well, one thing you could try is to follow a general rule - if your project is a lib, then float the dependency of react in the package.json
so that it picks whatever is specified in the including module (hopefully)
but tbh there aren't that many good solutions
hahahahah
well it shouldn't, right - it should recognise that the dep is there in the higher project and not pull it in
but if the versions aren't compatible, then it will pull them in
it *sort of* happens with clj too, when a project fixes a version of clojure
hmmm - how do they come from the same dep declaration?
ohhhhhhhhhhhhh wtf
sorry, misunderstood
one thing that might help you manage that is Lerna - have you looked at that?
https://lernajs.io/
we use it here and it's (so far) been really useful
it's from FB, as is everything else Reacty
yes
yes that is what refs are for - and it seems like that's ok in this case
not sure if it'll help but this is kind of what it is designed for - lets you develop what are essentially separate projects, with their own package.jsons, but then can be included as if they are npms.
patchwork: for the record, I've never seen anyone do this "file://" trick in package.json - that might be causing probs
right, which may not work that well
without a tool like Lerna
patchwork: can you look in app/node_modules/lib and see what's in there?
hmmm not sure, I was wondering if somehow the lib/ dir contained copies of its own deps, but it doesn't seem to
ohhhhh
this might be the prob
my guess is that you don't want webpack to run twice
generall webpack and browserify solve the problem of packaging npms for you
npms are specifically for *node*, which is a server-side tech and has module-loading capabilities
whereas the browser can't do that
so a webpack will emulate that for you in a browser
BUT
you probably can't assume it will work with two webpacks
so you should change your lib to be plain JS
with no webpacking
and then pull it in
exactly
it's the "linker"
in old compiler terms
(and it does other shit)
but basically, you need to run it as the last phase
yeah I think that's safe to assume (at present, anyway)
you lib can still use all those deps, no problem
but the webpack phase needs to be the last thing that happens
give it a go and see
well, are you testing it in a browser?
or do you just need to unit test it
hmmm
no
def no script tags
one sec, let me dig into your project
well wait - I think it's simpler than you might imagine
but the tools are confusing
you can think of npm dependency management a bit like Maven
it pulls down versioned deps recursively
those deps are for >node.js< specifically
"node package manager"
node is a server-side development platform
so npm works the way you expect
webpack is a packager
it takes a dependency tree and packages it, like an uberjar
EXCEPT that it also packages the classloader, that is entirely unique to that webpack
so your lib should work fine if you treat it as a plain node module
and to test it you would set up a different scaffold in your package.json
that can run unit tests or run a mini-webserver and serve it to a browser for testing
but that should be entirely independent of what is pulled in by other modules, who just want the code
am I making sense?
quile: and to test it you would set up a different scaffold in your package.json
[2:01pm] quile: that can run unit tests or run a mini-webserver and serve it to a browser for testing
yep
no prob
it's confusing but I think the "npm = maven" and "webpack = uberjar + classloader" distinction helps
it may be true that you can have one webpack pull in another and use it, but that shit does my head in
way easier to think about "webpack = last step" and do everything else before that
it's actually pretty simple - we have ~9 independent projects that are all build and managed by "lerna" and all exist within the same repo
so lerna builds them all and maintains dependencies and then webpack runs last to either deploy to the browser in realtime during dev, or at build time when creating an artifact to be uploaded to the repo
yeah it's nuts... and it changes every week :P
lol
yeah the frontend toolchain is :rageface: <- I wish IRC had the same emojis as slack!
^ scary
patchwork: did you sort out your react problem?
awesome!
You can totally keep components in separate projects tho
well we do it with lerna
there's nothing special about components - they're just JS modules
haha
I think I can help
Well, kinda - it's bad if you think about trying to target node vs browser
but just talking about one of them, not so bad
if you're writing code for node, it's pretty easy
yeah - I could come by one night and we could play a game and/or jam on JS
my rule for this stuff is: forget about the browser for as long as you can, and pretend you're writing for node.js
you components are >just< JS - they don't care if they're being deployed in node or in the browser
so build them as if they're just node modules
ha
yeah we should have a hack session
Usually I can find time - just need a bit of advance notice to be certain!
tomorrow I have soccer... maybe Sunday?  I will have to ask Tara... she might have something going on, in which case you could always come over
ok will let u know
justin_smith: don't spose you have any use for those maudio cards from that Juked PC?  we're selling them if you know of anyone who might want them
lol.. hadn't even got that far yet!  not sure what they retail for at present
but it'd be way below retail
not sure... lemme see if I have that in my email
you drive a hard bargain
haha
I'll verify that that's what they are - sounds totes reasonable to me!
That PC is also for sale, although I don't remember its specs
oh nice
yeah figured I'd either put it on craigslist or donate it to Freegeek
WTF WTF
justin_smith: the maudio cards are 1010lt's like you said
they're yours if you want them
sure can... good excuse to hang out!
they should just save up leap-days until there are enough to get us to e day
hahah yeah it did the rounds in our work slack channels.  hilarious
yes!  I pulled them from the machine and got them ready for you
patchwork! love femto
don't you kind of mosey past my office on your way home from work some days?
I am at E Burnside & 6th
justin_smith: ^
radical!  I'll bring them to work and then we can easily make spontaneous plan or hand-off
patchwork: So the idea is to deconstruct a language into something homoiconic, and then have translators from that repr to other languages
?
Or is that a side-effect of what you're trying to achieve?
seems like femto is kind of an assembly language
justin_smith: radical!
justin_smith: I keep forgetting to bring the cards into work with me... will try to remember.  Then at the very least you could stop by on your way home one day.
oy vay
yooooo
yeah life was hard at idealist, you're right
justin_smith: I have the cards and cables with me at work, FYI
no worries
I'll leave them here and we can do the swap any time!
it's yours?
justin_smith: how is clojure/west?!
awesome!
justin_smith: I'm at the office today so depending on when you get off work, we could figure out the trade
ahhh yeah, the thing he worked on way way back?
yeah that would work
what kind of time you thinking of passing by?
524 E Burnside, Suite 430
hahahha
ah perfect
I can come down and meet you so you don't have to come upstairs
541-380-0579
threeeee
yooo
yeah i'm useless
i was in SF for a bit and kinda fell off the face
a little, truth be told!
all good here... Premise is rocking along
how is life up on the hill?
hahaha yep
Oh nice!  So no need for the PC after all?
patchwork: sounds funnnn
justin_smith: I'll get it out of the attic tonight and boot it up and see if it's AOK
hmmm those were the only cables I had - and we had to order those separately
aren't there digital I/O cables as part of those octopus cables?
Oh bugger
I thought there were ~8 analog and 2 digital or something
per octopus
hahahaha
the life of a techie in a nutshell
ah yeah looks like we only had breakout cable 2 for each card
sorry, had no idea
heh
haha
HAHAHAHAHAHHAH
poem?
yum
noice
god csound was fun
hahaha
i have never, no
My brain hurts
It didn't stop Ramanujan
I can't express how much I love crazy shit like this https://math.stackexchange.com/questions/14115/motivation-for-ramanujans-mysterious-pi-formula
Totally
Which is also NUMBERWANG!
Isn't it fucking bonkers
the equation, and also the fugure
fugue
totally
It is outside of time
Great fugue -> mind blowing in its awesomeness
Listening to Liszt's bonkers transcription of it for piano - sooooo mental
IMHO captures the vastness of the original without really losing anything
It just gets bigger and bigger and bigger until it dissolves into stardust
I think I've listened to it 1000 times in the past week
I'm inspired!
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kvVhZbdtAe0
Now you know :D
If u want another bad-ass fugue, the "Toccata" from the B minor partita is actually a Prelude & Fugue, and the Fugue is one of the greatest.
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e1FBe9WHR_A#t=5m15s
dude you're gonna have to learn to drive to support your performing career!
LOL
hahaha
well hahaha
and also NUMBERWANG
yeah I can - just have to assemble it and make sure it works.  It has 32GB of RAM, which is probably worth more than $100 alone!
And I can def deliver
radical... will try to remember to assemble it tonight and put it in my car
Don't ever own a house.  It may be a "good investment" but it's a fucking time sink.
3!
hahahaha
the City decided to send me a notice saying I have to fix my sidewalk
even though it's fine, I have to spend $$$$ to fix these non-problems
fuckers
and then a huge branch fell off the tree in my backyard
so more $$$ to get an arborist in to look at it
no fortunately
Oooh hey I might be able to!
Lemme cerify
verify
hahah yeah that's the way it goes
different große fuge but yep I think so
justin_smith: Yo I assembled the machine and booted it up - seems fine
Windows tho, but I am assuming you'll obliterate that?
Or maybe there's a partition on the disk that I didn't see - it booted into Windows 7 and looks like it had all the drivers for the maudio cards and all their software installed already
Machine worked fine and it's in my car if you want it.
well you can't have it
heh I could also drive you home after work if you could get yourself over here
whatever suits - I'll check with Tara and see if she needs me to be home at a certain time.  She was going to go to some design event tonight so I'm not sure
I can see that!
THREEEEE
three?
threeeee
hard to get it just right tho
usually it's either too liquid or too crunchy
justin_smith: when you usually get home?
https://www.npmjs.com/package/crux-router
RAD!!!
sweeeeet
figured out what processor/etc it has?
Yep - when you said that you had some inkling that it's written in ML, it all made sense!
That's awesome
justin_smith: also yes IIRC it has 32gb of RAM - and all the slots are filled so 25gb sounds wrong... might need to re-seat the DRAM?
hmmm, there are 6 chips in there, IIRC
If they're all 4gb, then that's 24gb I suppose
maybe I misremembered - sorry :(
yeah no problem
JS is a mindfuck
So I would rename them something that indicates that they are React, and not use .jsx as a suffix
we say .react.js
so then it's clear in your import that it's a react component
and jsx is just js once it's compiled, and babel will take care of that translation on the fly for you
correct
import PieChart from 'foobar/component/PieChart.react';
yep
yes... I think it's babel-plugin-react-transform
I just pasted our package.json into the shared doc - you can take from it what you need
I think so - not sure what other bits of babel you need
hey sorry was in meeting
lemme find our webpack build config
ok dropped some shit that might help into the doc
you'll have to extract what you need - there's a lot of custom BS
Yep
and next week it will all change because some new flavour will emerge that everyone has to use
ouch
threeeeee
three?
justin_smith: did you get the maudio stuff working?
performing well?
gotcha
heh interested to hear!
ewwww
you're quite strange
oh weird!
have other people seen the same problem?
hmmm bummer sorry :(
well at least it's NUMBERWANG
right
hahahaah
^ this evokes weird images of Mad Max meshed with baroque oratorios.
yeah that's a pretty dire one
I am on a roll
ARGH!
Awesome idea!
^^^!!!
YES!!
hahahah yes!  It's so fucking awesome
Like something from another dimension
haha yeah
presumably because organs were mostly stuck in pretty fixed tunings that weren't equal
so they didn't range too far
excatly
oh man, check this shit out that I found
OK, this is fucking nutso
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5YBOmgi-qSs
A piece by Heinrich Biber from 1673
So listen to the first movement, then the second movement, which starts around 1:45 and your mind will explode
patchwo__: did you catch this ^ or were you in net.split?
justin_smith: you will dig that ^ too
yeah it's worth waiting for
I had always thought Mozart used polytonality first, but it turns out Biber beat him to it by 100 years or so
exactly
by Biber jumps pretty far on that one
yeah he was a super creative dude
He was one where all the movements are made to sound like farm animals
actually, not farm animals - animals in general: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71_kv1FpgfM
this is nuts too ^
hahaha
yoyo
well sure
hahah
I've missed everyone
oh wow - that's super cool for debugging
that's crazy
3!
space food!
hahaah that's rich
Hey!  I might be able to swing it - lemme talk to T
what kind of time?
ok I might be late tho - kids don't go to bed until 8
will try to sneak out early but I've done it a fair few times lately so...
i do say that, regularly
33
that would be odd
poem!
fascinating
nice

patchwork: so people are receiving their copies of Sol??
Not shown on that map is an Ethiopian place that is pretty dope.  It's just up 21st from Night Light.
ha sorry to just jump in with that
"Abyssinian Kitchen" I think it's called
Anyway, loads of good stuff around there
I went to the dentist today and I feel like I have a cranial thunder stalactite
(true story)
^ niiiiiice
fuck yes
!!!
^ that's almost too "normal"
as does that
niiiiiiiice
I wanna hear it!
3!
I held a walrus tusk last week at the Newport Aquarium.  It was >>heavy<<
I know!  That was exactly what I thought...
Presumably elephants have a similar problem
that doesn't sound appetizing...
hahah yeah I just saw that comic earlier today.  Classic.
nice work on the Xeon thing!
that's for sure!
patchwork: Yeah!  Wanna hear it! (just catching up now with all this ^)
It is truly "Great"
ah!  I didn't know that.
Bach loved to take folk tunes and elevate them
hahahah dude was the most badass of all time
haha it's like the "Musical Offering", where the emperor gave him a gnar theme and said "make a fugue", so he did, and then made "A Musical Offering" on the same theme
Also re: Pixel phones, I have heard great things from many people, and I work with lots of Android-nerds
hey justin_smith yeah Mahler is the classic case of being hard to properly record because of the mad dynamic range
interesting about the headphones... I have some over-ear noise-cancelling ones that I like and have been using at work to drown out the muppetry.  The in-ear ones tend to hurt after a while I find.
interesting
what brand?
Ohhhh Plenkton.  I love plenkton: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3cPs2SzShNc
oooh hmmm maybe... not tomorrow because I'm playing soccer but maybe tonight.  I'll check with Tara.
wouldn't be until after 8:30 or so
are you joining the alt-right?
if so, we need to talk.  you know they hate canine robots, right?
whew
edible does?
justin_smith: did this^ happen?
just curious :D
oooh!  might be able to!
sorry, been AWOL
have some family stuff during the day at least tomorrow but maybe evenings after kiddos go to bed
yeah Sunday is prob easier anyway
meaty1
3?
lol
I know... I fucking love it.  I dropped in that link to get some closure :)
i laughed so hard when I saw that
noice
maybe a bit less smoke
I think patchwork has these in his bathroom ^
justin_smith: Emerson Qtt is incredible.  I heard them playing Shostakovich a few years back and it blew my mind.
Also: yes, Mozart was very fond of the woodwinds
but I don't think it was an early experience; eg. the Clarinet didn't even exist when he was a kid.
yep, Oboes, flutes (transverse and recorder forms) and bassoons
Yeah I know you were joking... but also not so far from the truth!
Borodin Quartet too - they were his friends
yeah but what a performance
I only listen to music on wax cylinders so that I'm not ruined by fancypants audio.
hahahaha
!!!
For me Mozart is a god, so I'm glad you found something you like
lolllllz
Ooooooo hrmmmm
nice!
thankkkssss!!!
yeah his humour is legendary
one of the greatest musical humourists, if not *the* greatest!
noice
Learning some Bartók or something?
Ah rad!
brilliant.
HAHAHAHAHAH
Where did he get that from??
ah you're right
patchwork must have added that
hahaha yeah
ok there's the answer
pretty sure that just means a single viola with a piano part
I don't think so no
heh I know the feeling - I am not a great sight-reader.  It's something that I feel you really have to learn young, because it's hard to train all the parts of the brain required to do it well later in life.
yeah I'm glad I just happened to take up piano when I did, and not some wind or brass instrument.
I suppose there's a fair amount of decent solo music for guitar, violin and cello though, so those would be good options
just learn to read the bass clef and transpose :P
luverly
lol
nice
wow
hahaha
is it taco day?
shit, didn't eat tacos
FIFTY POUNDS???
holy fuck!
dude well done
amazing... we should go together to celebrate!
where is patchwork these days?
^go^get
Ahhh Annie got married.  Cool!
see?
something's wrong.  Try writing a poem.
Much better
DUDE WE NEED TO CELEBRATE
Lunch is pretty hard these days but after work might be doable?
Argh no can do - Fridays are usually out for me
Holy shit dude
sorry, just catching up
yeah we need to hang out
justin_smith: just watched that^^^ lolllzzz
I have FOMO and want to hang out too
wow!
hey did you guys hang on Friday?
only infrequently
hahahah yeah I bet it's pretty interesting
HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
that one seems familiar... like it's appeared before
true
I never wonder that, no...
eww
sigh, I am part of the owning class.  i've been duped.
THAT'S HOW I FEEL!
Awesome, that's even better than Numberwang!
"that way of the json"
exactly
noice!!
w00t!
OMFG I love that Fugure
Fugue
It's entirely diatonic; never leaves the white keys.
I MUST HEAR
Phenomenal!
Maybe you've found your calling!
Well I make music but there's no way in hell you'd want to record me!
hahahahaha  ok!
might be fun anyway!
heh
yeah we could probably use it too
"simian scrotum exuberance"
It was!
it is.
poem?
!!!!
That's commonly used in Haskell.
patchwork: are you talking about Clojure protocols?
noice
I am writing Clojure these days too!
I'm doing a proof-of-concept for a data pipeline we're working on, and it's been really fun/easy to write in Clojure
well basically we're ingesting submissions from our phones, and they come in as a big morass of JSON junk that gets merged with some more JSON junk, and then floated downstream... I'm trying to insert myself into that stream and extract and emit useful higher-level JSON junk
hahah yep, I actually have to talk to people f2f!
PGP is not secure enough for my barbecue sauce recipes
nice
you were Alice, and he was Bob
Now it's time for Wangernumb!
wow!
rad!
Incredible fact about Madagascar:  the language spoken there, Malagasy, is in the same language family as Maori and Hawaiian.   Figure that one out!
Unbelievable
yeah I watched it - you dropped it on FB I think
I am really only on FB for the family stuff and keeping some kind of connection open to friends.  I really hate going on it, and I almost never post anything.
Instagram is so much less noxious
(Ob)noxious
nice!
god I wish I could practice
not sure you want to take care of small children
but that's what's preventing me from getting piano access
hahahaha
I would never inflict that on you
hahaha
heh
It'll be ok... I am trying to figure out how to get them both into music lessons
hahaha jinx
niiiiiice
^^^^ btw "soup florin florin" is technically legal because "<noun> <noun> <noun>" is legal, such as "umbrella latch key" or "christ importance window"
yes, although we may want to tighten the rules a bit
maybe not tho... "buffalo buffalo" etc etc
I mean, I agree, the rules are good and don't need changing
and there are definitely no rules against repetition - otherwise it wouldn't have generated the all-time classic "redundant redundant ape"
hahaha lol
three?
ewewwwww
we can probably figure it out - wait until it subsides, then visit patchwork's house but don't use the vape.
:D
All roads lead to science.
lol
woah nice!
how long you there for?
Fun!
What are you planning to do?
fun!  I don't know any of those people but I am sure you will enjoy yourself.

Now *that* is a great 3wp.
the US seems to waver between theocracy and oligarchy but seems to have settled on idiocracy of late.

I KNOW!
how great would that have been
"The difficult flabbergasted vicar played on the rambunctious quark xylophone"
I am 100% certain that sentence has never been spoken in the history of the universe.
I wonder if that's true really, though
It might be easier than we think
Well it's not available to Google, so...
... does it really exist?
nice
"concave eternal resonance" is pretty good
justin_smith: do you know Leon Barrett? https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BzKjIk0vgzE
yeah I think I missed this one
we're interviewing him tomorrow
trying to get some background info
yeah that good movie coming in emacs, I can't wait.
nice
justin_smith: I have been to that intersection.
Well, Jackson Hole is not exactly a small town
it's super super touristy (which is why I've been there)
you have to admit, it's a *really* high quality web stream
I think we're going to put this on our 70" screen here at work, and just leave it up all the time
hahahaha
hahaha I had to close it
it was too fascinating
justin_smith: we really do have the jackson hole intersection stream up on our 70" TV at the office now.
It's mesmerizing
We're trying to figure out ways we can gamify it
zero.  Remember back at Instrument we talked about Bitcoin a lot.
We all should have bought.
NICE!
Ohhhhh
hahahaha
I own 4 Litecoins
Yeah that's why I have Litecoins
Just for fun
It's cool to watch them go up in value.
Exactly
I just been getting into spec
it's rad
It's a bit weird that predicates are kind of tied to keywords; haven't quite figured out how to keep the specs separate from the keys that they operate on
yeah I am not sure I agree with that - that's what I'm saying
I agree with most of the approaches in spec - building up your structures with predicates is great, and integration with test.check is so useful and awesome
HOW'S EVERYONE DOING NOW THAT BITCOIN IS $11,000?
WTF dudes, it's out of control.
haha yeah
maybe justin_smith was short-selling
I am waiting for my 4 Litecoins to make me a millionaire.
Did you guys know that the sailors on the Mayflower referred to the Puritans as "glib-glabbety puke-stockings"?
(seriously)
Also, only 40 of 102 people on the Mayflower were Puritans
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mayflower
not including ~30 crew it says
justin_smith: that's fucking hilarious
is there a game where you are assigned a random starting article, and a target article, and you have to try to get there in the fewest steps?
that'd be a fun game
do you allow backtracking?
yeah, in which case you lose
presumably the game has to verify that there is at least one valid path
well if you provide twitter credentials, dogdog will tweet every 3wp
yeah tbh I have no idea what pinboard is
so it's basically pinterest without all the bullshit
hey patchwork if I wanted to send a copy of Sol to my sister's family in the UK, what would be the best way to go about that?
lol
Bitcoin back on the up.  It seems to do that - every time there's a "oh, the bubble's going to burst" it seems to retreat a little, and then come back even stronger.
noice
hahahah Bach is in a league unto himself at all times
I feel like the Markov Chain stuff isn't working very well
justin_smith: I have been enjoying your festive posts
Oh that was what was going on?  I didn't quite understand
oh come on, that sweater is hilarious!
indeed!
lame!
^ that tweet is hilarious but even then, you'd have to be living in a cave *you yourself had hewn from the rock*
sounds like something out of Stranger Things...
poem!
it's always too early
sorry i disappeared for a few weeks.  got sick and then had sick kids to deal with.
SO TRUE!
lol
i have
it makes the rather large assumption that your keys are consistent across your data types, and that something called
:foo is always defined with the same spec... you have to bend things a bit to make it work differently
it's a nice assumption some of the time, but gets in the way when you're working with existing data
but it's part of clojure core now, so it's not going away
yeah the keys are namespaced
so it _sort of_ helps
the predicate-based approach is great tho
since it's arbitrarily complex and works with test.check to generate data and exercise your schema to test it out
yep
yeah it's tricky
from scratch, definitely!
DOGDOG!~
Poem!
poem?
ahhh thanks
hahah
https://twitter.com/botnikstudios/status/955870327652970496
This is true genius
I just heard.  SUCKS.
are you really?
ten?  is that numberwang?
Is one numberwang?
1?
10?
nice one.
poem?
EWWWW
oh cool!
Fridays tend to be tough for me but you never know!
Did you post it on FB?
:D
TIL that "to waffle" can mean to shit on someone's laptop and then close the lid
I'm dying with laughter
GOD I HAVE BEEN SO ABSENT!!
TRUE
ah!  yeah I am somewhat distracted by slack and forget about IRC
HI GUYS!
God, what has happened to me?  I am in meetings all day, every day, it seems.
yooooo
yeah sorry for the radio silence
you sound like Trump
Jesus H Tapdancing Christ it's hard to find good front-end devs these days.
what level would you put her at?
Hmmmm... is she pretty smart?
hmmm lemme find the posting...   https://www.premise.com/openings/?gh_jid=1068373
hahaha
lemme talk to her first
kyle@premise.com
No signing bonus - I am the hiring manager so it's a bit of a conflict of interest!
oh rad!
sounds good
no clojure here but lots of clojure love, and sensible use of tools like react/redux
and flow type
if she's interested, she should def drop me a line
cool - I've sent all her info to the recruiters and they will contact her
oooh good luck!
lol it is
except when you're not, and then we get worried
yep, flavour
poem!  gimme one
Ooooooohhh self-referential
Nice
gimme another poem
I was just listening to a podcast about that.
is that the impression she got?
yeah I only had a brief convo but my impression was different
our recruiter will contact her and let her know.  I referred her so I'm kind of out of the loop at the moment
since it's a conflict of interest for me to be too involved
yeah but he did say "she seems sharp"
so let's see where it goes
three 3 three
Oooooo that's a beauty
DUDE!
justin_smith: nice!  So the interviews went OK?  What did they ask you?
justin_smith: what's the story with funding circle?!
srsly?
Nice dude congrats on the new gigi
gig
The Bay Area is vile.  Just sayin.
but justin_smith that sounds amazing!
I can't stand it.  Overpriced to an extreme, the city of SF is a dystopian wasteland and the rest of the bay is strip malls.
Don't listen to me.
justin_smith: do they have an office here or will you be telecommuting?
nice!
so justin_smith let me get this straight...
you get to live in PDX, get paid a great salary, get to write Clojure every day for a company doing cool stuff, and get to travel to SFO every month?
JACKPOT!
congrats!
QUEEN SOUNDTRACK
lol
yes, it's the scientific term
are you though?
poem please
hmmm
SURE
and Beethoven, yes
how goes?  you started at Funding Circle?
so you're having to play catch-up a bit?
or just watch from the sidelines until the dust settles?
it is
^ can that exist???
That's quite a mouthful
what is an ubikey?
oh that's cool
So I use 1password for similarly storing passwords that I couldn't remember myself.  It's obviously somewhat less secure because it's a secure vault that would be vulnerable to attack but I'm willing to accept that risk because it lowers my overall risk.
hahah indeed indeed
Yeah it's a really cool idea
But doesn't it mean that anyone with your ubikey can log into your machine?
interesting
we are also having to deal with GDPR and lots of PII
funnnn
three?
hahahaha lol ultimate nerdery!
noice
three three threeeee
lol
hahahahah nice
lol
hey justin_smith I'm curious about your secure password USB key thingy
how do they prevent someone from stealing it and getting access to your master PW in plaintext
?
ie. if it emulates a keyboard, and spits out your PW when you press a button on it, then can't you just press a button on it when you're in a text editor and see the plaintext pw?  Maybe I am misunderstanding how it works.
hmmm
is it???
give m a poem
I toyed with spec a bit when I was on a spike a few months ago and I really enjoyed it
some things were a bit weird, like the assumption it makes about keywords mapping to specs directly
but the shit that you get for free with spec is so useful that it's worth the effort I think
also HEY GUYS!
I'm going to NZ in 2 weeks.  We should hang out either before or after.
justin_smith where is it?
yoooooooooooooo
East India Company
Yeah just going for a few weeks to visit the parents
India Palace!
Man, you work right near Target
You must spend so much on dishwasher detergent and tide pods.
Every time I walk into Target, I walk out with $150 worth of stuff I didn't know I needed
god it's crazy
*That* is a truly great 3wp
why not?
i bet it can, i bet it can
do you still write poems?
fabulous
heh no worries - I like you can be asynchronous here
I can't bc I haven't set up abouncer
ugh, looks like I might need a new job soon
I hate having to interview and stuff.  It's so stressful.  ARGH.
it's slowly going down in flames I think
and I can't wait too long to "see what happens" because it takes like 6 weeks to find a new job
urgh
yeah I know
I suppose good can come of it - it can put you in a better position after the dust settles
but still, so stressful.
hrmm
not sure I want to drop back to being an IC - although I do really love/miss CLojure
but I might take you up on that... assessing my options at present
for the time being, still have a job
poemz?
summer is over and the kid is back to school.  That is a good thing!
but I am looking for a new job and hating it
a few good leads.  a bitcoin exchange that looks pretty fun is prob the best lead so far.  there's also a good chance I can move to a decent startup that's already profitable by digitizing the inner workings of the construction biz.
s/bitcoin/crypto/
patchwork: how's the new gig?  what's it like living in the Bay Area?
hahaha shit sorry
I don't have a bouncer set up
so I don't get the history
I suppose he's recording everything we say
heh
yeah!
thanks!
starting to kick into high gear.  the crypto startup sent me a coding challenge and I finished it last night (mostly).  we'll see what they think....
the construction industry startup also got in touch and I have good change of breezing through their interview process so that's a distinct possibility too.  I've realised that humility is important during interviews, but I've also had a solid realisation that at the point I'm at in my career, every CTO or Systems Architect that I work for will actually have less experience than me, so I'm setting my sights higher and going for that k
of role.
totes
Yeah at this point I'm kinda ready
thanks!  depending on who I interview with, I will probably end up coming down to SF for interviews... will keep you posted!
also - can I use you as a reference if I need?
radikal
whew, the balance is restored
a bit
i am rich in phantom dollars
you did?
can you write a poem?
nice
FRIDAY IS MY BIRTHDAY
three?
so much irony
thanks!  sorry I was in interviews all day yesterday so didn't get to reply
Tara is taking me out to dinner
I am going to be Old + 1
[47]
I am in my Prime it's true
justin_smith: there are apparently infinitely many twin primes, so you will be between primes again at some point.  if you live forever, that is.
niiice
thanks!
patchwork: are you back in the bay area?
excellent
interesting
it generally works quite well until eng decides to grow a bit, and then it doesn't work any more
i am about to jump ship to a new gig.  it's all been super stressful, having to interview and stuff
but i have two really good offers in hand and am deciding by Friday
fuck!
i have to decide my next job by tomorrow and I am struggggggling
i have paralysis of the decision-making faculties of my brain
I can totally believe this.
my head feels like it's going to explode and i can't cut through the noise and get to the heart of the matter.
I decided - I'm going to PlanGrid.com, based in SF.
So patchwork I'll be in your neck of the woods occasionally
your prime is British?
Guys today I received a totally real connection request on LinkedIn from someone who works at a company called "Initech".  That is the name of the company in Office Space.  And the name was made up to make fun of companies with names like that.  >facepalm<
yeah it was a super tough choice
but ultimately I went with the one with the best prospects
the other one was Gemini.com - a crypto exchange
they both had really great offers
yeah they're disrupting some serious shit that's ready to be disrupted
after all, that's what any good .com is doing, right?
we should start a new startup that is disrupting the cliché space
two weeks... should be fun
yo patchwork the answer to your question is complicated, but the tl;dr is: new CEO was put in place at end of last year.  Guy is a total douchebag and the entire company is going down in flames due to his incompetence and douchebaggery.
I have stories that you wouldn't believe about this guy.  Or maybe the sad thing is that you would believe them, because silicon valley is filled with douchebags like him.
hahaha so good
YO!
good to hear.  you still do poems?
Awesome
what upppp
that sounds ominous.  “Instrument of Sol”
or awesome?
poetry please
three word poem please
lol!
poem!
sorry I fell off the face of the earth for a few months - was starting a new job and all that nonsense
indeed!
justin_smith: are you downtown these days?  we just moved into a wework near Pioneer Square
BLUESTAR
we almost went with CENTRL but they don’t allow dogs and my coworkers have dogs that they want to bring
hahahah I bet they do
yooo
thanks
new job always means everything gets disrupted for a while
new gig is good - i dragged three others along from Premise and we’re now the nucleus of an office in PDX
!!!
That is a great band name
OMFG Python is so so so so fucking terrible
I do
But you have to admit, Python is a giant clusterfuck of epic proportions
oh man.  sometimes it’s just too much and I have to rant/vent
the amount of effort you have to waste on versionitis problems and dependency bullshit is off-the-charts
patchwork: how is the air in the bay area right now???
yeah I was there for a quick trip 10 days ago and it was baaaad
I hear that Rust established some great rules at the beginning of its existence about dependencies and environments.  But most languages are a clusterfuck.  I think Clojure and Scala are two of the best when it comes to dep management, and they’re basically just using established Java patterns.  It has problems but fewer than any other system I’ve had to use.
ALL RIGHT! I got Numberwang.  First one in a long time.
I suspect that’s true, although it took them a few iterations to get it right early on, if I remember right
gimme a poem, dawg
lol
^ that’s an interesting concept
OH yeah I only just picked up on it
the Clojure hubbub - there must have been some bitching about something and then Rich posted a manifesto basically saying “STFU - we don’t get paid for this shit” and that’s the last I heard.
oh
warranted, or just whining?
hmmm
why not?  are you busy?
what about numberwang… 1 2 3 4 5 6?
1 2 4 5 6
11?
21?
33
I’ll take that as a yes
lol
oooh i like the ones that are simple, plain words juxtaposed like that.
I went to the Oregon Symphony on the weekend - they performed Rachmaninov’s Symphonic Dances.  Fucking brilliant.  It has a saxophone in it!
holy crap.  that must have been special
I heard her play the Tchaikovsky concerto a couple of years back.  She’s, like, pretty good…
oh man, and those partitas.
They’re incredible.
Yeah I remember once the Chaconne from No 2 came on the radio when I was in the car and the person I was with couldn’t believe it was a solo person on one violin
lol 3

11
it’s hard to get Numberwang
WANGERNUMB!
ewwwwwwww
^ Trump?
lol
Pretty sure I’ve seen some of those before.
nice
hahahah I want to make t-shirts with some of these 3wps on them
justin_smith: we should re-enable the twitter connection so that dogdog posts the 3wps to twitter as “threewordpoetry”
he hasn’t posted for over 2 years: https://twitter.com/threewordpoetry
yeah I need to get you the config for it
I’ll dig it up and let you know
hahaha nice
HAHAH
ok, maybe not
who is it?  is he incompetent or just doesn’t g a f ?
ohhh right I recognise that guy
urgh “move fast and break things” is a shitty lazy way to do stuff
lol
that’s kind of hilarious and genius
it’s like a VM that you can’t actually run code in - only instruct it from outside what to do
yeah totally
Nice
those are lovely
I do miss Scala - if you carefully avoid all the nonsense in Scala, it’s a pretty nice language.  But there is a lot of nonsense.
:D :D :D
patchwork and visits to pdx planned?
any^
I’m around the whole time!
\m/ <- metal
lol
I am also entirely off work from Saturday until the 2nd or 3rd
Got family stuff going on, but there’ll be plenty of time to hang
hahaha
Yeah!
I will also be in SFO Jan 28 - Feb 5
Yeah that’s how I feel
Well not at the airport.  I mean the city
I will be in >SF<
lol yeah, I have picked up the PDX habit of using the airport code to mean the city
ohhh yeah! might tough since I’ll be at work those days
“circular atoimic stupidity” could describe the cold war strategy of “mutually assured destruction” right?
Ohhhhh right, kind of like “The Trump Boson”
Or “The Kardashian Boson"
lol
tlol
I like that one
so many versionitis problems
so justin_smith I have the twitter config for you
it has API keys in it - how should I send it to you?
once dogdog has that config, he will also tweet all his 3wps to twitter for posterity :D
no sorry, I got your email
but then was flummoxed trying to figure out what to do and let it slide
haven’t revisited… will do soon
heh
I could also just put the config on dropbox and give you a link
and then delete it
exactly
patchwork: sorry I couldn’t play games on Saturday.  I spent much of the evening drugged up and in the fetal position due to headache.
patchwork: oh noes!  you’re out of that place?  what did you do with all your stuff?
like, piano etc!
patchwork: if you are willing to pay a monthly fee, you can store a piano at a temperature-controlled facility.  I stored mine with Big Al’s when I moved down to Argentina - it wasn’t all that expensive, if I remember right, and they pick it up and drop it off.
http://bigalsmovers.com/
I would offer to house it for you but I have no space!
*I* do, but not sure if Tara does :D
Plus my kids could fuck with it… better to keep it same somewhere else!
Yeah, juked was all built on FPGAs
I personally did not write the code for them, however, but they were cool AF
late to this convo again as usual but re: FPGA that guy had like a super German name didn’t he?  I remember the dude
Also, Amazon now has a cloud FPGA service, so you don’t even need the physical hardware, which is not cheap

“unitary chorizo power” is kind of amazing

my kids have those ^
hahahahaahaha

C is gorgeous
Give me C over a dumb language like Python any day of the week!
well nothing stops you from building abstractions if you want them
but nothing forces you into anyone else’s abstractions!
so it’s really “I do wtf I want” and that’s the best
right
how much faster was your C version?
seems like a good guess!
333
!!!
333
3~
gimme a three
ouch
33
333
I still play the air trombone and the hieroglyph bagpipe whenever I get a chance
ooooh - what are you going to use it for?
nice
I will be partially responsible for it when it arrives, yes
and it is coming.  It is coming.
3!
that’s a good one, but a purist might question “frogfish”
that one is pretty classic
HAHAHAH
we use AWS at PlanGrid, and deploys are handled by Spinnaker
at Premise, we were 100% Google Cloud, so I have some experience with that.
We didn’t do CD, just CI - deploys were scheduled; we built artifacts and deployed them weekly; everything was automated by Travis
so when we did a deploy, it would retrieve production config keys and inject them into the artifact that was deployed to production
so our keys were always well gated
justin_smith: happy belated birthday!
3!
i think “stalagmite intrusion gravitas” is better
and refers to how serious it is when you are impaled on a stalagmite
definitely serious
Somehow I have ended up working for an enormous publicly traded international company, in spite of my better efforts.  This is weird.
nice!!!!
funding circle went public!?
well done dude :). your timing seems impeccable!
Eleven years at Idealist.org and what do I have to show for it?  No stock options, that’s for sure…
But now that I have stock plan stuff, I understand the appeal…
That’s a pretty good one
I love that concept
yikes
:D
33
333
^ AKA smart phone
hahahahahaha
33
i can’t say I totally grok the problem - are you saying that if a value goes below zero, the entire state is invalidated and something has gone wrong and we have to start over?
like, it’s an unrecoverable error?
patchwork: any chance you could do it by queueing deltas rather than trying to write into the same box?
then you have one consumer reading deltas from a queue and updating the box
333
ew

lol
ooooh that’s a good one

all really good poems, dogdog
that too!
^ that’s a very 420 poem dogdog
that’s very practical
insane in the random membrane
lol
heh lovely
so much joy in this robot
this weather is nuts
you’re weird.
Wow - that’s a naturally occurring 3wp of very high calibre
give me a poem
beatiful
beaUtiful
I like that one
now *that* is a nice juxtaposition
Do you guys remember when we had the idea of writing something that wrote programs using solutions found on Stack Overflow?
Amusingly, someone has done something similar: https://stackroboflow.com
It’s so hilarious tho
It’s also numberwang!
YES
a few days means I can get something pencilled in
so if you *can* that would awesome
patchwork: what is your show on the 29th?
noice!
Happy bday JSBach!
patchwork: it’s hard to know exactly when his birthday really was… he was born before the gregorian calendar was adopted universally so dates are pretty confusing…. but either way there should be a JS Bach Day and today is as good as any!
just about!
I love noun fondue.  It’s my fave.

you are definitely trying for Numberwang
:D
Interesting.. you got some examples?
heh
justin_smith: where you at these days?  I mean, I know FC, but not sure where
v cool
Ohhhh yeah!  We are only a few blocks away - at least for the next 2 weeks.
We should meet for lunch!
After that, we’re being vacuumed up into the mothership that is Autodesk
Yeah exactly - it’s absolutely incredible inside
Exactly!  The cool thing about the PDX office is that it’s mostly Maker fare - products for manufacturing etc
so there’s like a 3d print room with all kinds of gadgets etc
I can give you a tour once we’re situated
Happy to oblige
Cool - will be in there in June
yes we got acquired
Autodesk is a badass company.  I’ve been really pleasantly surprised by how cool they are, and how much effort they put into making their employees happy.
No, and yes
So I was so fresh that my option deal hadn’t even been ratified by our board by the time we were acquired
But Autodesk figured out a way to engineer a deal that was the same or better, so I’m not buying a yacht or anything but come September I’ll be able to pay off some car loans and shit
Yeah, and their benefits are great - and they do a ton of good charity work, pay us to volunteer, match donations, etc.
ouch
yikes that’s fucking frightening
reminds me of that scene in Wrath of Khan
“They put theengs in our eeeears, keptin”
I am not allowed IRC at the office and I was travelling in Europe for a bit.
how is everyone?
poem please!
yasssssssss
poem!
I gotta figure out how to join this from work.
only joining from my phone is really harshing my mellow.
dogdog gimme a poem
that’s a bit too realistic.
another poem please
yes!
justin_smith how you doin’?
where is patchwork these days?
yeah I’m using some janky iOS client for IRC that looks like it was made by a teenager in his/her basement...
what’s your work sitch?  we should meet up some time and catch up!
I bumped into Jordan Sowers and Ryan Garber last week at a bar.  it was cool to see them. Garber is still at Instrument.
I will investigate glowing bear
I also need to investigate weechat.  I am not cool enough to know what that is!
ah ok
gotcha
