The gravity gets you down but you'll get used to it.

Pretty sure David Bowie wouldn't have been able to write "Heroes" in a DC Suburb.

the next feature is to allow any users to add adjectives and nouns

nice
we should have it chain them
so it can respond to all of them
so 3D would give you a three word poem and a markov chain
hahah
hahah
it seems to like hernia
here comes Zalgo
hahaha
ZALGO IS COMING
we should have dogdog join IRC channels we don't like
hahahha

?
i hope you guys are seeing the minimalist genius of the 3wp.
hahahah
the day it generated "redundant redundant ape" was one of the best days of my life
brilliant but fake!  there's no way that guy's windows machine was up for 4 years/
for sure!
hahah
3wp

patchwork is an android, not a bot
right dogdog?
ouch
hahahahahha
i feel like the corpus of words for markov analysis is being mangled by the mere presence of dogdog
yeah i was going to suggest that we chain everything together
ouch!
Three tells dogdog to generate a three-word-poem
no, only three-word-poems are supported currently...
Ausgezeichnet!
I think colloquy can't really handle a lot of Zalgo
it slows down a lot when there is Zalgo in its scrollback buffer
All unit tests should incorporate Zalgo testing.
Ahhhh hahaha I think I had one of those earlier
indeed
