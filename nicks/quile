The gravity gets you down but you'll get used to it.
Yeah, DC suburb < Berlin
Pretty sure David Bowie wouldn't have been able to write "Heroes" in a DC Suburb.
well all the frontend peeps are going to Lisbon

justin_smith: NUMBERWANG is one of my favourite gameshows!!
THAT'S NUMBERWANG!
ha ha ahhaha
the next feature is to allow any users to add adjectives and nouns
so we can expand its vocabulary
poem!
nice
we should have it chain them
so it can respond to all of them
so 3D would give you a three word poem and a markov chain
hahah
hahah
it seems to like hernia
here comes Zalgo
hahaha
ZALGO IS COMING
hahahha
of course
he should be able to be in multiple rooms at once... is that possible right now/
?
i hope you guys are seeing the minimalist genius of the 3wp.
hahahah
the day it generated "redundant redundant ape" was one of the best days of my life
brilliant but fake!  there's no way that guy's windows machine was up for 4 years/
for sure!
hahah
3wp
sure thing... dealing with some dtc stuff and then i'll drop by
ouch
nice
I need coffee Z
It's too early. 3
giant magnetZ
patchwork is an android, not a bot
ouch
hahahahahha
yeah i was going to suggest that we chain everything together
ouch!
no, only three-word-poems are supported currently...
Ausgezeichnet!
I think colloquy can't really handle a lot of Zalgo
it slows down a lot when there is Zalgo in its scrollback buffer
All unit tests should incorporate Zalgo testing.
Ahhhh hahaha I think I had one of those earlier
indeed
you need an antifungal shelf unguent.
clojure-bot has that
hahahahaha
radical talk on clojure, overtone, etc. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mfsnlbd-4xQ&feature=youtu.be

poocafe: when you get a sec, can i borrow you to help me with my spring static resources issue?
awesome, many thx 3
poocafe: are there any examples of your new CanRenderDirective in the templates?
I am trying to figure out how to use it
ahhhh ok awesome
i just found the config where you set it up
haha
hahaha
ZALGO
poocafe: isAuthorized directive works great!  I realigned the naming in the class and tests too
thanks for implementing that
hahaha
brilliant
"placid donair vision" is a brilliant 3 w p
So when patchwork is in, he can set up the new version
precisely!
hahahaha
(galaxy is already there)
if he doesn't respond, it means he already has it
(poor UI, I know)
i think it catches the exception, no?
hahahaha
justin_smith: no hyphens
group-theory is a compound noun, we don't like those in 3wps.
i need to add a spell-check to any words added to the vocab
well, hang on...
yeah you're right
hahahah!
hahahahha
agrh!
spelling error!
patchwork: I will add a remove-noun and remove-adjective setup
then we can all edit the db
let's get the handler-chain set up and then we can easily write plugins
yikes
!!
patchwork: i believe so yes... give it a go.  i am pretty sure i tried that
well, clearly you were meant to play the church organ then
can't wait for null and nil in the same poem
and generates a poem with it, then removes it

you guys should read b3ta.com if you don't already.  it's an incredible manifestation of the that sensibility.
the b3ta weekly newsletter is often the most brilliant thing you'll read all week.
i'd want to allow it but it breaks the "three words" rule
yes, three
I love the imagery that 3wp invokes
http://500px.com/photo/40357406
thisisjohnbrown, "3" or "three" or "poem" will get you a three word poem
how about a poem?
Indeed.  Who is Guest94137

it was joked about on the Daily Show yesterday
we're using tika for DTC
patchwork: as I work on this DTC stuff, I realise that a very useful/important feature that we should add to Caribou is an event log that tracks everything that happens (within reason).
to a DB table?
we really do need it - i'm making one for DTC now
indeed, but not sure exactly when, might be a bit later than usual depending on DTC tickets
wow: http://www.thisiscolossal.com/2013/08/time-is-a-dimension/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+colossal+%28Colossal%29
but then it drives you to the brink of insanity.Z
DIGITAL BALLS ILLNESS!
WHAT SHOULD I LISTEN TO?  I can't decide.
OK, Op. 131, here I come.

The Dance of the Seven Veils from Salome is badass
Don't laugh at me.
Don't agree with me!
i have him working on DTC
and the slug doesn't match in the DB
there are no verbs in three-word-poems!
Does the ST programming language look like this:
i guess they have many PDX locations now
ROCK ME AMADEUS
that's quite a boring 3wp

patchwork: I am done fixing that admin bug - we could update versions and try to bump weareinstrumentv3
for weareinstrumentv3?
tika worked beautifully for us in DTC

wait that 3wp is invalid
so, i have to test massive uploads for DTC, but I don't have a 5gb file
Does that mean "yes"?

guys, this is stuart halloway's "narcissistic design" talk from another conference: https://vimeo.com/77199361#
this is the site: http://usvsth3m.com/

and (3) you only allow that user to generate N tokens per M time
