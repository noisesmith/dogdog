call for proposals: should postmark expect attachments to be base64 (which is what the underlying library expects) or should it automagically convert non-string-args to base64 strings (ie. if it gets a java.io.File should it suck up the file and base64 encode it or just throw an error?)

patchwork: I am trying to figure out how to import the dev db but not import any changes to asset fields - any hints?
OK, this is terra incognita for me, but that sounds reasonable
ahh, yeah, of course
my real problem will be figuring out what to import and what not to import
hell, I could do a full dump via model api as edn, and pick out what needs importing
yes
mostly just model actually
the content could be filled in, the model stuff is the important part
I am realizing I can load up the other config in the repl, and compare them via repl model interaction
patchwork: yes, we do need a general method for this
I am going to do what I did with syl and start writing migrations
it was easier with syl because nobody else was editing models, so I just did all my changes as migrations from the very beginning
DUDE
patchwork: do we have a function that does diffs on nested maps?
args to update-in!
return a lazy seq of update-in vectors paired with prev/new values?
yes, but the args to update in are trivially transformable to the model operations you would want
and a good default format
or maybe I am missing something here
I am thinking breadth first, starting with model differences, going down to deeper differences if you ask for them
because of course the output could be rediculous, but a good coding would expose them as they are asked for and often once you get the first few model differences that would often be all you really need from the tool (other changes not being important)
this is arbitrary depth
but breadth first would likely be most useful, since the data has a human consumer
oh yeah
so the important thing is to show model differences first
then content differences other than updated at / created at
I think?
yeah
but with a smart ordering you could just pick a dividing line, use all changes before that, discard all after that

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmiZpGvnYY on youtube
I got it via amazon mp3
what are the odDs
if all http related functionality should be in frontend, does that mean s3 should be a frontend overlay on top of core?
yeah - my attitude is that frontend should not even be checking if assets are on disk or s3 - it should call the wrapper that farms out at the caribou.asset level
I could build in some more user friendly s3 specific stuff on the lichen side though
looks like I will be able to generalize s3-resize so input could be an image in your own s3 bucket, or could be at some other arbitrary URL, and the resized ends up under the bucket (and will be looked up if you ask for the same input / options again)
3♠

(some are standalone mp3s of pieces, others in subdirs named after albums)
patchwork: logistics! in s3, should I still be abstracting out the asset root before generating the hash, or can we count on people changing buckets rather than asset roots within a bucket?
instead, I am taking the s3 url, chopping it into constituent strings via regex, pushing in the lichen stuff in the right spots via string concatenation, etc.
patchwork: another question: lichen-resize returns a java.io.File, that is impossible for lichen-resize-s3 - do I return a socket that is ready for a .read operation for compatibility maybe?
"AmazonS3Exception: Status Code: 400, AWS Service: Amazon S3, AWS Request ID: 3AA8153E4C84D6C1, AWS Error Code: RequestTimeout, AWS Error Message: Your socket connection to the server was not read from or written to within the timeout period. Idle connections will be closed."
patchwork: any idea what would make s3/put-object not read or write to the stream?

(problem was a size header larger than the image output, turns out s3 rejects such things)
quile: it turns out that a few of the #clojure folks are NZ based clojure web devs
another thing: s3 gripes that we don't specify an upload size for the resizes
if I give the size of the input the whole operation fails because what is sent is too short, and s3 decides that was an arbitrary error and bails out
(model/impose :luch-plan {:where {:date (java.util.Date.)}})
{{environment}} {{^= environment :development }}NOT DEV{{/= environment :development }}
prints :development NOT DEV
thomas had an awesome suggestion for s3 assets: protocol relative links
when no height or width is specified, the s3 upload is handed nil instead of a handle to read bytes from!

I was thinking, alternately, of trying it with the Disruptor lib
also, somewhat related, it may make sense to have a more generic "how to upload a resize remotely" config, instead of specializing in parallel on local / s3
like config could have a "lichen store cache" function, which creates a file as a default, then we can provide a "upload to s3" option, and others could be plugged in (ftp to asset server, whatever)

"java.io.EOFException: Unexpected end of ZLIB input stream" could it be trying to unzip the file before the file is completely created? I guess that makes sense because when you scp it starts as a 0 byte file, then gets appended to
alt tab moves linearly (in one direction) across things in a two dimensional space (three dimensional in a standard workspace that does not tile) - it is more useful to move via alt-arrow in the direction of the window you want
so (swap caribou.logger/loggers conj [7 (fn [level s] (println (Date.) " : " (string/upper-case (name level)) ": " s))])
better than what I suggested above: (swap! caribou.logger/loggers conj (fn [level message] (caribou.logger/stdoutlog level (str (Date.) " - " message))))

it could be used, just has an unneeded conditional since assets will all be s3

patchwork: https://github.com/zavg/Asis <- run it in a working codebase, it tools things to generate tests, keep the tests, then refactor code and see if they pass
we should totally do this with caribou
if we generate the tests from site FOO, and the tests pass with the new caribou version, than FOO will work when we upgrade caribou versions
basically record / replay for app state come to think of it
oh, shit, it is a php tool - it needs to be rewritten in clojure :)
heh
the concept is straightforward
it ties into that same thing I was talking with technomancy about, recording requests in order to replay
add to that some tooling / tracing
...
should be doable as a middleware
anyway, I passed asis along to some of our poor longsuffering php using comrades
D O G D O G D O G D O G
patchwork: so here's my concept for a replay middleware: for each request it generates a form, that if eval'ed will generate a duplicate of the request
this is because the request can contain stateful objects like request bodies
you can eval the form to replay the request into your handler for debugging
you can copy the form into a unit test, to save at and test future versions against it
if not for the unit test part I would just generate a function of course
I think so
it could be a handler, just put it at the bottom, so it gets the most raw version of the request
the tricky extra bit is some bugs also rely on state of the db etc., which is of course not generalizable
you can't serialize a db connection state, without something like datomic
D O G D O G
I was just thinking we could have had that conversation in here

dodog, just don't ever say OGC, because that is obscene
I just did a postwalk, and got the class of everything in the request map for 45 requests: #{nil org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpInput clojure.lang.PersistentVector java.lang.Integer clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap clojure.lang.Keyword java.lang.String clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap}
so teh HttpInput is the one tricky one I guess? everything else is immutible
working on making that serializable (thinking of a scheme using byte-array and io/copy, should be easy enough, base64 so it can be in a source file as part of a unit test)
he is obsessed with s3, and validity
I was imagining that the binary explosion monad gave form to pope trapezoid
and pope trapezoid got a vasectomy
patchwork: http://sprunge.us/jdAM?clojure I am getting all the requests, encoding their body to base64, and storing it in the request map serialization - the next step is to call the handler on it for replay
the tricky part was replicating the body to another stream, while also having a copy of it that was just a string to munge
I should wrap it up in a tee-stream function
eh maybe it is not working properly actaully it appears the post body is not coming through :(

I am now officially a paredit user
groundhog now has default methods to store, sanitize, and replay requests
and an opts map to provide alternatives for each
replay is done by default with a magic /replay/<count> URL which triggers a replay if the request comes from localhost

but will also work as a standalone ring handler
patchwork: cool, I hope to put some time into it after I have this handler too

so, over the weekend someone at jenkins ran a script that did a git push -f, and it totally destroyed a bunch of the repos jenkins owns on github
there is something very ironic and sad about this
patchwork: if github allowed access to the remote upstream, they could find it in a reflog
if they looked before a gc happened
patchwork: some of them do, not the guy who made the mistake
so hundreds of their repos got forced commits of old versions of the repo
from a guy who never pulled, so he did not have the refs locally to fix the issue
yeah, but it's more complicated than it could have been, since they don't have direct access to their main repo
of course github recommends having few devs with push rights to a repo, and using pull requests, but jenkins was just giving commit access to everyone
but, reading about this, I learned about reflog, and its ability to help you find orphaned HEADS for recovery
which is cool!
if they just made the script do a full fetch before pushing, even if it ignored upstream contents and force pushed it would at least have the refs needed to restore anything it fucked up
patchwork: yeah, sure thing

patchwork: did you just tell me to update the README, and then immediately do it yourself?
I'll merge in my updates too
OK, I was surprised to update, and then get a merge conflict :)
usage has not changed, though it could be expanded on
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure is this where you submitted the caribou announcement?
heh
you didn't mention #antler
yo
wassup
patchwork: still there?
so bitemyapp had some constructive criticism, if you didn't see
our usage of specials in with-config and wrap-request are likely to cause problems with async because special vars are per-thread
a workaround in the short term could be to pass that bound value in any async call
except with http-kit
with http-kit you could see issues sooner, since it is implicitly async
yeah, on #clojure
it's good to find out this way instead of from a bug in production, but I don't think there is an easy fix
the straightforward way to do it safely would be to add a config argument to *everything* in caribou
which would kind of suck
for example if you have a websocket
heh
no, its just in the template when the app is created
that's all
not the very latest, no
so the special var bindign issue would be for example in httpkit, you open a socket, and the thread that serves it is not neccissarily in the same binding context as the one that created it
since binding is a per-thread thing
or if you did polling on input (as the version of lichen that does indeterminate s3 upload does)
one of our handlers in caribou.app
thats the one
we can't take for granted the request is handled all in one thread
so that could break
cool, yeah, it didn't seem so familiar
so, I wonder - how big a change would it be to put config in the request map instead of a special var, and then pass it to the functions that use it (or use functions that use it)?
maybe that is just too much of a pain in the ass
but it is the cleanest, behavior wise
the second best being let over lambda, using config to return configured versions of each function
which means changing less code maybe
but then you can't just use namespaces in an idiomatic way
will it always be?
I guess if we can take that for granted, worst case is you end up in a thread without config bound
is everything guaranteed to be spawned from the handler?
I suggest asking bitemyapp some of these questions, he is surly, but he has a good eye for the unforeseen consequences
what I mean, is anything going to start other from in init
then it won't be bound
not sure - I am mostly passing along the concern second hand from bitemyapp
he was pretty convincing, but you are also
you may want to go to the source
as I mentioned earlier today, his hobby horse is proper reentrancy, and clean reproducible non-global config
yeah
and I think his argument is that it should be possible to have k configs
that do not interfere with one anotehr
*one another
and that is where the mess happens, potentially
if any async crosses the config boundary
I am not sure it would
http-kit, he says, makes it so you cannot take for granted your request is handled in one thread
though with our model, everything would be handled under the config gathered up in init
more than one, I think
but I am not the expert
I use it for preparing migrations
debugging a bad change to a schema
but none of that should be in a request handling context
I think his claim rests on the fact that due to the async nature of http-kit, your request could be passed between multiple threads as it polls for client data
yeah, that was the one he pointed out
wait, what was the thing with immutant you thought was fixed?
right
I think it was similar to the search indexing where I needed to override some function from a caribou ns to pull it out
I will have to retrace my steps
what about having an immutant-handler and a non-immutant one?
the immutant handler could be in a mini-lib that is separated off in order to isolate the dep
that is where immutant would be, right, in the default handler?
right, so that could be isolated - a mini alternative handler for immutant maybe?
if that is so heave a dep that it needs isolating
definitely
very similar issue to the search-indexing
nice to support, but can it be done easily in a way that is not intrusive for opting out
no, I just replace the code that invokes it
I don't know, because I take it out knowing I won't be using it on tomcat
maybe it is more specifically a beanstalk issue
I will have to sort that out, I should keep copious notes when I create new sites!
the issue is it uses the disk
if it is not referring to a directory outside the app, it gets clobbered with a new deploy
right
hell, it is even hypothetically possible on beanstalk
I was talking to a web dev on #clojure who was talking about integrating s3 assets / local assets workflows
I was realizing that there could be a middleware that abstracts over local disk vs. s3
based on what we do in lichen, but making it a separate concern
ie. if you want to serve up objects locally in dev, and from s3 on prod, and just know it would be handled identically
the middleware could abstract the differences away
well there is the dual of access, which is the storage
but of course we could abstract over both
I'm gonna have to call it a night
see you tomorrow
nice
he's been here for a while
we should direct future caribou talk from #clojure to here if it starts getting more active
yeah, my thoughts exactly
patchwork: clojure.walk2 disappeared from the clojuresphere (in terms of maven accessibility) with the exception of the caribou fork!
we should put your walk2 repo that I am sure is on your box up on github, so we can at least let people verify the version before requiring it
it would be the polite thing
the author retracted his jars
I assume in the same way a turtle retracts his limbs
well the fork is on clojars
lol
lein search clojure.walk2
the only result is caribou/clojure.walk2
sierra I think
you obviously forked it at some point, now it is the only readily available version
well, we could retract ours in sympathy, and break a shitload of code assumedly
people are fixing their code that stuartsierra broke by retracting his lib by pulling in our version
YES
THE SAME DUDE
so we are doing the world a favor by mirroring his lib, but it would be nice if we also shared the codebase behind it as open source citizens
erm...
our repo is not up there, but you pushed ajar
*a jar
lein search clojure.walk2
you could fork his github and make that the new jar
walk2 is still on git, just the jar is not out there it seems
this is the same guy who fucked all the clojure.data.json users
wait, did something similar happen with tools.namespace?
he pulled the lib because it was accepted as a patch to clojure proper
to replace clojure.walk in the next clojure version I guess
but that doesn't help people using old versions
sweet!
nice feedback
for r/clojure 25 karma is a lot
sweet
forks this soon, awesome
probably taking immutant out :)
it's cool to be compatible, if only there was an easy way to make it opt in

fixed the spelling
seems useful for catching intermediates concisely
so you don't need to turn a one liner into a let
or for debugging, at that
reducers have something called reductions
that return the intermediate values at each step, right?

patchwork: windows shit
heh
windows is so weird
it is hard to differentiate actual apps from malware
maybe because I am so used to malware imitating windows
but I got lein and git and caribou all working
and mostly verified my path fix
oh, that
the site takes a long time to load on first visit
because the page is like hundreds of jpegs
(that is what I think the reason is)
but we are using nginx / varnish / s3, so I think my ducks are in a row
we may want to look into loading the images more lazily
http://teague-staging.elasticbeanstalk.com/
OK, got that sorted out, let's look at schmetterling
github pooped all over the teague repo ;(
the page is a 500
the repo does not respond
it pooped on it
just created a teague2 for the interem
indeed
I guess it could have beeen a worse kind of poop
like if pulling replaced the entire set of references with garbage
heh
heh, yeah
you know, Leeeeeeroooooy Jenkins would totally do a git push -f
on 4000 repos at once
awesome!
so you just need to make sure clojure.jar is in the target classpath, and then you can use clojure to debug DTC
wow, the continued responses to that "do dev apps need caribou" thread make us look really good
congrats patchwork, the world is exposed to your genius

patchwork: (clojure.repl/source-fn 'clojure.repl/source-fn) -> returns the source as a string
patchwork: also if you look at the source for source-fn, you can see how to ask for a random resource and get an arbitrary range of line numbers from it
which could be useful for a lazy interactive browser (get a few more lines as they scroll maybe)
quile: you around?
 it was about this thread on the clojure mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/MzBnqDsV3wc I made a branch to move templates under templates/_admin
I caught all the usage of partials, and all the lookup of templates in controllers (I think), but the asset picker now looks for _admin/... without the preceding templates/ which doesn't reflect any change I made, and of course breaks that UI
I am guessing it broke some javascript magic, and you don't have to fix it, but a lead to what makes this happen so I could fix it would be awesome
if you have any
do you know where in the js I would look for things that generated a template location
?
OK
the templates are clean
I will double check the controllers
yeah I got all of those already
and template/find-template inserts templates/
something is not inserting templates/
that is why I suspected js
especially suspicious is replacing templates/ with _admin/
that makes me think bad js regex or something :)
but thanks anyway for the suggestions, this isn't urgent at all, and I may figure it out after all
it would be a nice to have for sure
heh
on that branch?
cool!
I wonder what I fucked up on my local
awesome
well thanks for proving I'm somehow a dumbass then :)
I'll figure out what I did wrong locally, and continue from there, thanks

I got my first "any caribou guys around?" on #clojure this morning
(it was the guy getting the old version of fs via lighttable
I suggested he try lein pedantic and some :exclusions clauses
then I didn't hear from him again
right, that was my thought
still our version of fs seems to be up to date
so I picked up this video game called "luxuria superbia"
you fly through an abstract flower and paint the petals
it is totally obscene without any explicit content
the flower starts pulsing when you fill in enough of the colors
but if you fill it in completely, too fast, the flower tells you "oh, that's too bad, but it's ok, this kind of thing happens to everyone sometimes"
to get a high score you have to keep painting the petals (by stroking the flower buds inside(?) but not too quickly - just the right pace
like I said, totally obscene
I was just about to ask you how to turn on query cache, but instead I googled it
we have finally reached the point where I can google caribou questions and get a good answer instead of asking your directly
eventually I'll just be asking google where you want to go for lunch
https://github.com/noisesmith/quad-tree <- readme, with an image in it even
and the basics work (now for traversal and search)
the svg lib I found makes debugging graphic stuff pretty simple
since in inkscape each polygon is its own object I can inspect for geometry and even arbitrary properties (hypothetically)
let's make a 3d data structure visualizer with an oculus rift + kinekt UI
for hollywood style debugging
I know we could totally do it
add a canvas to schmetterling
the trick would be the data structure rendering - we could make plugins
hashmap, vector, list
even showing the internal structure if we are ambitious enough to
yes
I can't believe I waited this long to turn on query cache
it should be there by default in production.clj
I am doing that edit right fucking ow
*now
maybe, checking
does the template use caribou development still?
is reloading something I have to turn off explicitly?
OK, this google search is not properly optimized yet: "caribou turn off template reload"
OK, I put it in explicitly anyway
doesn't hurt?
anyway, pushing the query-cache option to caribou-development / develop
or should I push to our lein-template?
one thing I got working in teague that is a cantidate for caribou: a model in the db for remote resized resources
so the caching can happen at a db level
so if cached in ram, use that, then check db, and use that and propagate to ram, then check remote, and propagate to db and ram, or create the remote, then propagate to db and ram
this is just for the location of the asset / the fact it exists
it seemed like extra complexity at first, but adding that layer makes the first few page loads much nicer
speaking of prewarming, is there a way to force all the routing and such to build before the first request comes through? I don't think that level of laziness is actually helpful
yes, and then something loads verbosely (and time consumingly) with the first request
maybe not the routes but all the controllers being evaluated?
it is just this initial load that could be happening when the app first goes live
instead it make the first request take 20 seconds to get served
*makes
not slowing
if I wait 10 hours between the boot and loading a page, the big chunk of processing happens then
the printed messages are about defining the routes
erm...
on prod I am
and that first request takes a while on prod
yes
and if that was the issue, we would see the hit every time
but it is just the first page load
there is clearly some code that is not getting hit until the handler actually runs
right
maybe it is the way handler is defined
whatever it is, it would be nice if that big chunk of work could happen at app boot, and not wait for a request to come in
could be an old thing that already got fixed
just incidentally
I'll look into it again if I see it on the next site
patchwork: the cookie handler I set up for admin seems to set a cookie for every request, which may be interfering with varnish
I wonder if there is a straightforward way to only set the cookie for admin usage? or should we be setting a cookie for every visitor
maybe the middleware I am using for the cookies is fucked up
or maybe I am misenterpreting the response header preview in chrome

clojure macro of the day: as->
(as-> {:❄ 0 :✈ 1} ☃ (assoc ☃ :🌰 ☃) (update-in ☃ [:❄] inc) (into {} (map (fn [[k v]] (if (number? v) [k (inc v)] [k v])) ☃)))
it is like -> but you can explicitly decide where the arg gets substituted
heh
above code evaluates to {:🌰 {:❄ 0, :✈ 1}, :❄ 2, :✈ 2}
kara just asked me to invent a password, I don't know if she realizes what she is getting herself into
CACHING ISSUES
the frontend sees 503 that is not reflected on the caribou side at all :(
UGH
well I hope it is that simple
plan: remove varnish, serve nginx directly
create  a new ec2 instance to debug all varnish issues
sound good?
patchwork: not varnish
there is 500 with no corresponding output
patchwork: one is beanstalk, the other ec2
there is actually no way to turn off indexing
I thought it was turned off, it was just failing semi-gracefully on beanstalk
and breaking catastrophically on ec2
yes
but not having it should be an option
I guess I could have set /dev/null as my indexing dir
we probably can
I was prioritizing, and they did not ask for search
so I foolishly thought not having it was the simpler option
hey patchwork did you find out or-> is a clean fix for needing functions in the -> macro?
it is pretty cool
(as-> {:❄ 0 :✈ 1} ☃ (assoc ☃ :🌰 ☃) (update-in ☃ [:❄] inc) (into {} (map (fn [[k v]] (if (number? v) [k (inc v)] [k v])) ☃)))
it lets you pick the symbol, and explicitly place it at any nesting in each form
you are only binding one symbol
in this case ☃
it translates to (let [☃ (...) ☃ (...) ☃ (...) ☃ (...) ] ☃)
right
with the layout of ->
similar for immutant
it is easier to make things default than optional
right
it comes up because it is a big download
and used to be an intermittent error
(random stack traces from not finding part of the immutant setup, as far as I know that part is gone now)
right
patchwork: another clojure easter egg (this a silly one): (keyword "-)")
OH SHIT
for now, I can create /var/lib/tomcat7/caribou-index]

patchwork: what is the best way for me to get one table's updates from one db to another without breaking things
I moved the assets over from one bucket to the other, now I need the corresponding asset objects to exist in the db
but I have had bad luck with partial dumps / loads
and that would properly import them with the right id?
because the id is magic with assets
OK, I'll figure something else out then
patchwork: what do you think of adding Cache-Control http headers to s3 assets by default?
cache-control prevents the client from downloading the image anew on every page load
basically it is a promise that this object will not change within some period of time
s/prevents the client from/allows the client not to
otherwise the browser is pessimistic and grabs the thing each time in case it changed since last reload
ralfonso: what is a reasonable cache-control setting? 100 years? 1 day?
also, for most images, adding a cache-control of public would be good too
public tells any other server that no matter how many users ask for face.jpg they will all get the same file
cache-control: forward-from-grandma
every computer user is assumed to already have this content on disk
nice
we should make multiple tagged non-intrusive trace panels
each panel gets a name, so you can do (schmetterling/trace request :top) and that traces the value of request to the top panel
then you can just create arbitrary numbers of panels for output, and categorize what traces to each one
maybe - that may require some magic
it's just a parameterized print
print this value, plus print it in that location

oh cool
we doing clojure today?
we could try integrating my quad tree lib, which should be cljs compatible (except for the svg rendering part, which is unneeded in cljs)
insertion works, and I have a walk function, but some of the search functions are not in there yet
a deep walk is not really the way to search a quad tree :)
we would write a directional search that would start with a given path to a point in a quad tree and find the next item in a specific direction that matched some predicate
in order to measure gaps, find neighbors, find closer packings, etc.
what works already is checking if points are occupied, and inserting to create the occupied structure if they are clear
which is already potentially useful
(reducing the number of comparisons, in exchange for the extra quad tree branches created)
yeah, absolutely

patchwork: what is the current story with model and content migration?
patchwork: cool
cool
sounds like the right thing
I just ordered a copy of that "high performance clojure" book that just came out
patchwork: lunch today? it's been a while, between my long weekends and teague shit
csound now runs inside pnacl
so you can serve up a synthesizer as a web page, all the c code is translated to javascript
and do the UI in html
I will have to do this with clojurescript
also, people area working on hooking clojurescript into the javascript support in the newest OSX and IOS
*are working on
yes we do
also, if it looks like a change needs to be done to weareinstrument do I just jump in and fuck with it, or should I check in with someone about it first?
they want some static text to be controlled by the cms
too many short term cooks in that design :)
as in changes that should be integrated?
hah
yeah, figures
I'll check in with phong
maybe I can check some of the clojure stuff out and bring it back to coherence
patchwork: I hva luxuria superbia running if you want to take a peek
yeah, opens up a lot of ideas for alternative game design

https://github.com/stuartsierra/component looking at integrating this library into caribou
as a general startup / configure / shutdown / reconfigure design to fit everything else in
HAH
I almost forgot
OK, if I try to use it, I will plan to fork it
but it is a good design
I am thinking that, plus avout for coordination, plus some solidified middleware conventions plus the still to be discovered clean way to register and find hooks in clojure for migrations = caribou.plugin
patchwork: we just need to sell him on a backward incompatible change to his attitude to backward incompatibility
after that he would be prevented by basic contradiction from ever embracing non-compatibility again
I discovered today that ring middleware can use mutliple args
if we ever decide to separate things out of the single-god-map model
I hadn't thought it was possible
if our own middlwares are compatible, we could have handlers be their own map
s/handlers/helpers
{d,f}uck {f,d}at
I hate fuck dat
it looks like stuartsierra's component library could encompass both config handling and migrations (we could extend our components so they also take an arg that returns their migrations - the funcionality of looping over all components regardless of namespace is already provided)
patchwork1: inkscape is the OSS tool for vector graphics
it even does a trace function to import from a photo (then you can go in and delete / adjust the breakpoints it autogenerates to make a cleaner vector)
also incscape files can be read and manipulated as data structures in clojure

"we run all our caribou deployments on immutant"
I have never used immutant, and had no idea we were using it in production
I had no idea
I have them outnumbered by 1 I think
I'll have to try it I guess
like I said, I have never tried it
I guess because the *nix ecosystem is something I am pretty comfortable with already, so I wasn't looking for tooling to help me deal with it?
but it isn't like I decided to never try it
I just never got around to it
I am brainstorming zero downtime upgrade for caribou
zookeeper (avout) will be the lynchpin that makes it work
once we have proper inter-instance coordination, we can do version upgrades to an app where at any moment at least one server is handling requests
with a short moment of indeterminacy where some requests are handled by version x of the app, and some by version y
hah
let me just run a quick git gc before you do that - anyone got a hammer or maybe a car battery?
quile: are you saying there is some java functionality that already does what I am thinking of?
heh
it's fucking magic - I set an atom in one vm, and the value is instantly seen in the other
yeah
simple simple
now to embed it into the guts of caribou
no more "restart your caribou because someone else added a page"
http://vlazzarini.github.io/ csound now runs in chrome via the magic of pnacl
the c code is compiled into chrome byte code, and runs in the browser, controlled by js
with a recent enough chrome, it just works, no visible downloads or anything
dude! kinda
with web sockets for collaboration :)
those unicode symobls are supposedly "face savoring delicious food" and "pot of food"
does model/init clear the query cache?
I'll look in the source, thanks
I guess I could also find out empiricially
it does call invoke-models
bind-models may do it in invoke-models
I will experiment (using the latest caribou template)
if m/init does not clear it, I will call query/clear-queries
which clearly does clear it all, looking at the source
first I will make avout work with the models map in config
second step is query-cache busting
should both be totally doable
hmm
with query-caching on, model/init is not sufficient to see new models
I think I need to manually bust the cache then run model/init
yeah, I can just clear it manually, if that is the design you indended
by calling caribou.query/clear-queries
since the db request model/init does is using the cached query from the last model/init
well I will make a pr for that :)
should init bust the cache, or should invoke-models do it?
will do
actually avout was going to be done as a standalone middleware
no changes to the rest of caribou
OK
with avout as a middleware it is then immediately usable by other non-caribou projects, and easy to use by caribou projects that do not use models, etc.
basically I have with-zoo, which takes a key name and a server an updater a function, and returns a function that behaves like the original, except it runs the updater if the key changes value
and the handler is with-zoo with the appropriate server and key args
but it is even usable outside a ring stack, you could wrap any function that should be coordinated in with-zoo
well, the db page changes should be visible when the cache is busted
or do you need to tell pages to reload? if so I can throw that in the updater
will emptying the pages make the reload happen, or do I need to regenerate them in this handler?
(if appropriate, of course)
I can test this empirically of course :)
ahh, so I can set :reset true in config
and it does the rest
err...
no
ahh, so I would call it if pages change
food cart indian today?
or robotaco
ahh, that looks right
thanks
wait, what about calling the reload-pages that is defined in the same core ns?
ok
if there were a comment or two in handler.clj I may have realized this sooner :)
making progress...
patchwork: annie? cool
I am going to have to figure out how to extrapolate from the structure of the query cache to a value to invalidate any matching cache in a peer
*the value to invalidate in any
filter those keys that have changed, and share those keys so any peers know to clear them in their query cache?
I want to do a more granular busting of the cache
so I am looking at which keys changed, to propagate that info
maybe I should just do an all or nothing cache bust though
that would be simpler
because I am capturing the values in a clojure
and testing equality
I can do full map equality, or by-key equality
sorry, in a closure
(let [queries (atom @(query/queries))] (fn bust? [] (if (not (= @queries @(query/queries))) ...)))
http://rorywalsh.github.io/RIBCsound/index.html <= webapp that creates a synth gui, and then exports gui plus csound code as a standalone page using pnacl
the webapp is open source
https://github.com/rorywalsh/RIBCsound
quile: being coherent as I is a fairly low barrier
regarding the earlier talk about integrating avout
since zookeeper is a big external dependency, what about keeping it optional by putting {:query {:storage-method f}} in the config map? and then you could set the method to use an atom, or an avout bound version of an atom, or whatever
patchwork: got a moment to hash out a zookeeper design issue?
I think I found a way to minimally alter core, and integrate the avout functionality
no prob, just let me know
quile: patchwork: I got a very reasonable suggestion about the wording on let-caribou.in what repo would I clone to make a pr for that content?
seems I don't have the perms
https://github.com/Instrument/caribou-marketing I see this but it does not seem to reflect the site
anyway, the request was just s/performant/efficient which I totally agree with
did you add me? thanks if so
? maybe it was that caribou team did not have access to let-caribou-in
I thought I was on the caribou team
anyway I made a "buzzword-reduction" branch, with one small pr against master for now
patchwork: nice
patchwork: all for replacing the whole deal
if we can come up with something better
AWESOME
it appears varargs does not work on protocol definitions
I will join the chorus
I guess I could manually define all arg counts from 0 to 10
hah
impale competitors on your mighty rack of antlers while building domain apropriate data models
hah
oh, the trick for defnining the state-coordinator protocol: the implementation for java.lang.Object is just the arg (for reset) or (f this) (for swap)
and just ignore the varargs versions of swap!
which is not so onerous
quile: indeed!
(extend-protocol gripe java.lang.Object ([this f] (f this)))
almost a pun on "object"
patchwork: were we actually using update-config? because it looks like as is it treats value as a function if the arg is not an atom, but as a value to replace the old one if it is an atom
which is weird
unless I misunderstand this code
it is defined
that is the only instance of its existance in all clojure projects I have checked out
never called
so, all this work for something unused!
but I will make it coherent
so maybe it will get used
and this protocol way of doing things is better than putting a bunch of functions in config anyway
dependency injection ftw
just ran lein check on caribou-core, I am going to look into some of those reflection warnings one of these days
woah, jvm 8 eliminates permgen
replacing it with "metaspace"
patchwork: you never told me you were designing java 8!
it seems so, I need to do more research on how so
anyway, you should know since you helped design it :)
http://java.dzone.com/articles/java-8-permgen-metaspace
it is marked as separate from heap, but draws on the same pool, and the same maximum usage quota
so if your heap size is big enough, it will expand
unlike permgen
fair enough
the space in which we store space
I just found out that http-kit is within 10% of nginx's performance
and tomcat is significanly slower than either http-kit or jetty
I say we ditch the tomcat and nginx elements on the next caribou deploy, and just use http-kit (running the project as java -jar) and varnish in front of it
TIL calling peek on a vector in clojure returns the last element in O(1) time
but calling last on the same vector returns the last element in O(n) time
!
weird
suddenly I realize why you would use peek
I used to think it was kind of pointless
MOTHERFUCKER
we keep things in model/models that are not serializable
so we cannot use a distributed store for them
glad we had that talk :)
I just fucking got it
models, query cache, and reverse-query-cache all in zookeeper
WOO

and I'd like to thank all my loyal fans
quile - fucking a, we are for real huh?
https://github.com/noisesmith/reins reins is live
rein in your reindeer
literally two lines of code in your boot.clj, and one in your project.clj, and you get coordinated caribou state
nb: requires my yet-to-be-merged caribou branch
the awesome thing is how fucking small that plugin is
I even took out the clojure / caribou deps on the project, to make it clear it is an extension you add to an existing caribou
depending on performance, I may update it to an incremental change model
rather than shared data as it is now
that would be faster, but more complex to implement
not too complex for me mind you, just complex enough to be a bad idea if we don't need it
what a nice way to spend my vacation morning, rescuing an ec2 production box that died
the ec2 instance fucked up
they told us it was due for replacement soon... about the same time the thing stopped serving requests
well a little after - when we got the message I checked the site and it seemed ok
but died shortly after
I did a bunch of futile shit to try and recreate the env, but rt got it snapshotted and got the snapshot running
*r2
patchwork: so regarding zookeeper / avout, I got it working but the load that using it for config would put on zookeeper may be a bit more than zookeeper is designed for
so if we want to use it in production we may have to go back to my initial "trigger changes" model
but for dev time sharing config via zookeeper should save a lot of hassle
small key value pairs
not huge maps of queries
the idea being it sends a signal, not provides your data
but like I said, during dev this should be fine
it is designed for low latency, rather than throughput
*rather than high throughput
patchwork: http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Data+Access
"Zookeeper was not designed to be a general database or large object store."
every write to a key is a full replacement of the entire key
so every update to any model means replacing the entire model map
unless we made each model a zk key
that would scale better
right, like my initial suggestion, if you remember :)
well, that is what zk provides, what we need is to hook into it
I think you can have a watch on an avout atom
yeah, add-watch works on avoud distributed atoms
so you add a watch to the atom, and do the db call appropriate for that atom
so put an increment in the atom, if we see the value go up, we do a model/init
and any client can swap!! inc to make the others reload
the watch triggers if you change it
or if someone else does
that is why a number helps
well my idea is each thing we watch would be its own distributed-atom
each one idempotent
so we would have one for restart, one for update-models, one for clear-cache(key), one for shutdown
to keep things simple
yeah
you could think of each one as a route
but not using ring of course
regardless, the pull request on caribou-core stands, and whatever I/we design for this can use the new protocol
so caribou core can treat it the same way
also, avout has a mongodb backend, so maybe we can use avout/mongo, store the shared config as a distributedatom that way, and call it good?
I will look into that
in other news, I am working on the caribou plugin protocol and coordination
and if my plans work out we can marshall all the hook and migration setup through caribou-plugin
rather than configuring each of these things by hand
well, as I mentioned I've been hammoking it for a while
and I had kind of a breakthrough as I was working on the avout integration
sure
at this point nrepl is a protocol, not just one app, btw
I answered a stack overflow question about using datomic with caribou(!)
one more thing about the nrepl/schmetterling thing: it requires no changes to nrepl, nrepl takes middlewares, and you could have a stack navigation / code sending / alerting middleware - it would be some work, but requires no change to nrepl
you would get a handle to a frame/context and what to display there
and provide it to have code evaluated
may be more trouble than it is worth, but it seems possible
it would provide a means that nrepl users could hook it into their UI
right
and no need for you to do that for them
all they are asking is we consider talking to that protocol
well, there is ritz, but nobody can make any sense of its design
it is trying to act like the common lisp debugger, by abstracting over jdt - poorly
I commented on the schmetterling thread (which you probably noticed)
patchwork: you still around?
so I was looking at some stuff yesterday, about clojure webservers
http-kit run via java-jar on your clojure uberjar should be within ~10% of nginx
in performance
so we could drop both tomcat and nginx from our standard deployment
and just have caribou/http-kit behnind varnish
*behind
two dependencies
yeah I noticed
for security reasons?
what could a client do by connecting directly to http-kit that they could not do with nginx in the middle?
oh interesting
OK
and that isn't something the varnish layer could do?
no, not much
just used it for this latest deploy
before that we used beanstalk
or SYL, where maybe someone else set up nginx
I am willing to accept nginx as manditory if must be
patchwork: nope, no tomcat on syl, it dates from the multiple jar days
right
yeah
that's fine, if we need nginx. Just wasn't aware.
I would like to replace the things tomcat did for us though
like log coordination
and hell turning printing to stdout into logging
tomcat did a few nice things - by my count I would want: a service definition in /etc/services such that we could run "service caribou [start|stop|restart]
and logrotate setup
and turning stdout into logs
that is mostly it
right
and that way your app does not need to be root
but varnish can help with some of that too
it has some overlapping functionality
just scheming on simplifying things, including the deployment stack
patchwork: I think it can, it has routing options and rewrite options
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3334023/configure-multiple-sites-with-varnish
wait, that may not be exactly it
anyway, varnish is a full on DSL (varnish config language, vcl) that can do a lot of fancy shit
I used it to turn off cookie creation for the non-admin parts of the site when I discovered that I was not using the cookie session store properly and it was setting a caribou-admin cookie for all requests
true that, but slower than a bunch of the java alternatives(!)
based on benchmarks at least
probably because good threading is harder to do in c, so they end up being more conservative, so you get more bottlenecks
https://github.com/ptaoussanis/clojure-web-server-benchmarks
that is one set
see you tomorrow
yeah
notice http-kit well outperforming nginx
patchwork: when you get to more load (more threads) thus my theory
there is another one I don't see at the moment
that quile was fond of sharing
patchwork: rough sketch https://github.com/caribou/caribou-plugin/tree/master/src/caribou/plugin
my thought was hooks (if any) would be added in the migrate method
hmm, yeah, may be better to be more explicit
but hooks don't really have a functional interface the way handlers do
in usage you would have to ensure you replace your config / plugins with those returned, because the input is not modified, the whole lib is functional
ahh
so the same thing I do for helpers, I'll throw that in, why not
and that provides the end user the chance to wrap a hook before they get applied, if it pleases them to do so
easy
thanks, I put a lot of thought into it
yeah
by extending java.lang.Object you can just ignore the methods you don't supply, and get the noop version of the method
*since it extends...
we could cut down the line count in caribou core by doing something similar with the db adapters
good, me too :)
no, they don't
but I think we can make it happen
we could make a persistence protocol
the current db stuff would be the sql implementation of the persistence protocol
then a query protocol, similar deal
right
query.clj could just be made a specific implementation
then we pull out the stuff that is actually more general
but worthwile!
I love the idea of any given storage backend being an injected dependency
shrinking caribou as much as can be done, and letting the user extend it
so we could make a caribou-sql project, and a caribou-keystore
and any given user would only need one of those, plus an implementation that implements that protocol
If you think of a good way to divvy up the task I am willing to put some hours in. Though I fully understand if you want to have control over that change.
cool
also, while we are at it, it may be cool to do explicit separation of state from config, plus at least the option of passing in config / state as args rather than binding them as dynamic vars
the more I mess with stuff, the more wary I am of dynamic binding
fluokitten? I'll look into it
or data.lenses
https://github.com/cark/data.lenses lenses are really interesting
I redefined "state" in caribou.plugin.state to be totally persistent and stateless
I left the names unchanged for irony
being motivated by irony makes me feel like a batman villian
https://github.com/cark/data.lenses/blob/master/example/src/example/core.clj lenses runthrough
ouch
so maybe we don't need lenses, just the ephemeral lost monad lib it uses
is it on sonatype or something? or they just point to a silly version
patchwork: caribou meeting today?
we've pretty much been doing that over IRC already anyway
this whole conversation could have been on #antler

patchwork: http://www.emacswiki.org/MiniMap yay we can have minimap like those silly sublime-text users
you can use it like a scrollbar
grab it and scroll it
heh
it is like a scroll bar but more informative
in general
the shape of some part of your code is often distinctive
we could ask for tertiary displays
just for our minimaps
I want a tetrahedron of displays surrounding me
one of them with a hinge so I can crawl out
you do
it is just a very large bubble
like world-like in size
you could call it a planet even
heh
‽‽‽‽‽‽ HAWII
patchwork: also, the minimap had top level definitions in a much larger font, so it acts as a TOC showing you where to scroll to get to that definition
which is maybe the best part

https://soundcloud.com/information/dec3 patchwork quile made this this morning, not a noise piece
viola quartet
I did a bit of copy and paste rather than memorizing
so it is pseudo-improvised
I should port that clojure svg lib I found to cljs, it is nice
thanks
I'll be needing a better viola soon
and some skill
and more time practicing
I intentionally repeated the uncertain bowings as a framing device
but yes, I also do that
almost every repeated phrase (literally copy and paste in the editor) had and uncertain or flawed attack to it
heh
it could be known as an opening or pause
the wisdom of recording a moment of uncertainty for posterity, on the other hand
is lunch
(migration/run-migration migration)
yay for naming
as predicted re that github issue
everything going as planned
quile: vim trivia - does vim have a concept of a buffer with no file associated?
cool
and you can edit that buffer I assume
technomancy is plotting some extension to nrepl protocol with content types and magic, so that question came up
it can already send html to a client, which is what he suggests if we were to integrate schmetterling/nrepl
patchwork: I don't think I like this interface for migrating from the plugin, and I wonder if we can add a layer decomplecting migrations from namespaces
I am thinking plugin maybe shouldn't provide a namespace, but a unique key
right now the only way to do a proper migration is to pass in a string for a namespace
I vote we keep that layer
but abstract the code finding from the logging/checking/applying
so that I could provide a key, if that key is in the migrations my migration is not run, if it isn't, my migration is run and the key added to the db
just checking in before I start hacking away at that
OK, letting it sink in, it is a small fix that will be backward compatible, I will issue a PR as usual
I am officially fully ingrained and addicted to paredit mode now
design question: one migration per plugin, or allow them to return N migrations that we iterate on?
right now I am leaning toward having them return a [[migration rollback]*] sequence
to pseudo-regexp it
right
sounds good
it occurs to me that we will want to make migration a model, rather than a table
I think we can bootstrap
either that or only sql users get to have migrations
seriously
did I mention my org -> edn converter pipe dream? still scheming it
well edn -> org first
as a way to get structured inspection with collapsing branches
hs-mode will collapse sexps
but I like the org mode UI better
really I would use it for data structures in general, less for the specific code case
would it be too much magic to also update the pages/handlers in the config when the plugins get initialized? for now they are returned and it is assumed the user will take that step
could make a config key for it
lol
regarding the migration bootstrap, what if each storage adapter defined its own "reify-migrations" migration, that turned the migrations table into a model with fields?
planning ahead
and interacting with things that will need changed
OK
this comes up because I am needing to modify migrations in order to use them from plugins, which gives me insight into how they will need to adapt to other storage
big plans
not to worry, just doing plugins now, everything compatible with existing usages of caribou
making it work with teague, by putting features in teague into plugins
D O G
patchwork: can one define a caribou page with a function that acts as controller, without needing to bind the function in a controller-ns?
if not, I want to make it possible
ahh
is there a branch with polaris integrated?
or is this something I would need to do?
I guess I can test my plugin shit with the "alter-var-root on a var in the controller ns" method, if it comes to that.
and in the meantime
I am glad we are making these things more general
smoothing all these little bumps once and for all
until caribou is a mirror reflecting pure inspiration
lunchdog
patchwork: check it out, you can open a string in a new buffer, and when you save it replaces the string contents https://github.com/magnars/string-edit.el
it handles escaping and shit
I'm down for lunch
so string-edit-at-point is awesome
in the string-edit package, I linked it above
open the string in a tiny buffer
when you are done editing, it escapes the string
so you can edit the string in an unescaped format
also it works recursively
if you need multi levels of escape
(print "\"\\\"hello\\\"\"\n")
double escape
patchwork: http://sprunge.us/Ygba
a function I have been wanting for a while in emacs, I finally just wrote it
elisp is kind of annoying actually, now that I am used to clojure
I mean delq nil mapcar instead of remove nil?
pretty much
someone wrote a graphic towers of hanoi puzzle solver in posix complient vi
this is a feature we need by the way
bulk asset creation would be nice
or do you mean a different guy
do we have a simple function for creating an asset for a file by path? if so we could show him a small file that defines a migration to create his image+xml two asset model, and then a loop to create one for each pair it finds
or tell him he can do that and show him where our functions are
(the migration definition and asset import)
we do have one function that will import an asset from a file, right?
awesome, great to hear
in caribou.asset?
oh, the :source key
still working on that one turing-oracle we need
clojure has the "bean" function so we can turn anything into a reified bean - or is that refried beans/

and it blew up in your face and you hate me forever
oh, what failed?
it only works with a macro if you know the class string at read time
that is true of macros in general
ahh right
I think we can adapt that
(name symbol) for one
ok

heh, why not both?

this morning in my SPARE TIME I finished up the alpha for plugins
let me make sure the latest is pushed
https://github.com/Instrument/teague/tree/plugins/src/caribou/plugin examples of what plugins look like now
pulling them in: https://github.com/Instrument/teague/blob/plugins/src/teague/boot.clj
using them in the handler: https://github.com/Instrument/teague/blob/plugins/src/teague/core.clj
less than perfect, but looking good I think, and all features are tested
I had one more thought: if we want to call boot and init plugins for migrate, then we should have a separate "run" method for plugins (that is called in core) for the repl plugin for example
patchwork: the args are arbitrary
they are in the definition of the individual plugin
they read the config
ahh, yeah
yeah, right now create is not in the protocol, it is a wrapper around extend
right
those things are in the way an individual plugin is defined, rather than the plugin spec
true
let's not architect it though :)
I mean someone will want to make a function that outputs plugins, and it may not work with map args
or some whatever
you know
that as-keymap macro I showed earlier was so I could avoid doing {:reload-pages reload-pages :provide-connect-data provide-connect-data ...} when initializing the handler list
there is a reason it is just in the one handler definition (which is still teague specific) and not in the plugins namespace :)
working on it
so, as I was saying the run method
since we want to load all of the plugins for the migrate task
but don't want the repl-plugin to actually start a repl
or the ring plugin to start a webserver (if we took it that far)
but there is a clear path forward with that, just a question of doing it :)

"My new thesaurus is terrible. It's also terrible."
yup!
because foo is the head
clojure is actually very clumsy about optimizing compared to eg. haskell
for example (nth (map #(Math/pow % 12) (range)) 2000) should totally be optimizable into one op
but clojure will evaluate all 2000 operations
in that case, it is because haskell is strict about side effects that haskell can just jump to the right index, but clojure cannot guarantee that there are not side effects you want
this one will not change in 1.6
yours might
since that is just an advanced example of locals clearing
I meant "not knowing what is impure / pure" by "this"
your example has some hope of being optimized, since it matches the vision clojure devs have about what you can expect from clojure, my example is considered a "not gonna go there" thing (they said this directly to me in IRC)

"The Chinese knew about the tempered scale even before it was invented in the West, but they chose not to use it. They seem to have decided to put the differences to good use. If the equivalent of "do mi mi, mi so so" sounds different in the equivalent of their key of C and their key of E, then that is a useful thing because the feeling that goes along with those sounds is different."

patchwork: check out page 159 in the above
he describes a set of lemmas and rules to create a vector-space of notes
"Sets H (melodic intervals), G (intensity intervals), U (time intervals), and T (intervals of time separating the sonic events, and independent of them) are totally ordered. We also assume that they may be isomorphic under certain conditions with set R of the real numbers, and that an external law of composition for each of them may be established with set R."

thanks
watching the world melt (I have some big windows)
my hot water line finally thawed this afternoon
(it was only frozen in the kitchen, but had been frozen since thursday)
it is a sign of warmer weather, to be sure
I will be hiking off to the liquor store before long, James gave me some Gin and Bourbon recommendations
and I got a couple of 12 packs of beer in the fridge (full sail ipa, fat tire ale)
I hope so
otherwise I need to drink a 24 pack all by myself!
well maybe I wouldn't
doing the last minute minor tidying up, reading about category theory, listening to Borbetomagus
they represent the crossover of harsh noise with free jazz
no, guitar, two saxes, all with pickups, all played through one amp
they are famous for this maneuver: http://www.paristransatlantic.com/magazine/interviews/photos/borbetojimdd.jpg
I may have even mentioned it before
they combine the two saxaphones into one resonant body
(sometimes even using a clamp to secure them
)
the dude on the left with the hendrix shirt, he really does want to be the hendrix of sax
also he invented an inductive pickup that combines with a metalic reed
or something like this
to amplify sax in a way more similar to the electric guitar
perhaps - though the guitar still uses the resonant part of the string and not just the plectrum
a string and a tube are direct analogs
a reed is not an analog to a plectrum or a bow though
Indeed. That's why it's not like a bow or pick.
right, it is a part of a system including the air column
cool, I do hope things continue to melt, enough that folks will make it here
Outlaw friended me on facebook just so he could invite himself to the party
lol
interesting, I hope the ordering order ordering helps
I am imagining a set of comparitors ordered by the sorting algorithms they should be used with
AY OFF
I drank too much
r2, efi, and outlaw made it
spangler did not
a couple other random friends were there
annie, dunno if you met her
ahh, thinks were all melted last night here
I spent much of the day trudging around (getting to the liquor store and back) in the slush
icy, but not slick, just slushy
shit
too bad
we'll have to make a weather raincheck, I still have most of the booze, though I put a decent sized dent in the gin bottle - but the wine did not get touched
yeah
nothing compares to beethoven
which is sad, because I want to listen to "something like beethoven" so all I have to choose from is more beethoven
WOE IS ME

hmm
OK
cool, I am particularly interested in chamber stuff

hmm
what's the space comparison problem exactly again?
ahh yeah, there is likely a way to make that much cheaper (ie. taking each one and returning all shapes that it fully surrounds - which is far fewer steps, especially if you remove the contained ones from the list to check)
because the point is to make a simplified (shorter) version of the spaces, removing ones that are fully contained (thus redundant)
next question is how that balances with the added bookkeeping of inserting / removing spaces from/to the quad tree at each step
but it could definitely be worth trying
I think my quad tree lib needs some work though - it is not fully featured
yeah, my quad-tree lib would likely be a head start for that
since it is cross compatible clj / cljs especially
HEADSPACE

patchwork: I just made an uberjar, but when I try to run it it complains that it can't find the main class - any idea why?
that sounds right - so I add :gen-class to the core ns?
I want to skip the container
well, it did complain about not finding a class, so that is intuitive enough a thing to try
so because I am doing a gen-class on the top level ns, that means it is precompiling fucking *everything*
destroying the illusion that my machine was fast :)
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YbNmL6hSNKw amazing
hmm
well, the tank drives in the direction the fish swims, so if that actually works, I'd say a fish should figure out how to control it
seems to fit fishy intuition - swim in this direction, I go in this direction
you could test it by making something that the fish would want, and see if it consistently seeks it out
like maybe a heat lamp
a fish would likely want to find it again, if it was visually distinct and led to being a bit warmer
FISH

also, nice way of referencing the aquarium paradox :)
patchwork: a false lead :) maybe it was an attempt to reference the brain in a jar paradox
still quite apropos
also: trick was to (of course) have a -main, set the :main true and :class-name "my-ns.name" options
and the uberjar running httpkit is ALIVE
IT'S ALIVE
MUAHAHAHAHAHAHA
it's a nice alternative to tomcat / jetty if I can work out convenient start / stop aliases as a system service
which is said to be a thing one can do
log output and rotation will be step 3
now once I get nginx basic auth sorted out, it will be running for reals
the caribou-cms.wrkbench.in server
so that we can deploy stuff as we work on it
it's just an ec2 instance of course
but while I am at it I am trying to improve the deployment platform / process if I can
may as well
I am on the road to being "the guy who gets nginx", but I am not there yet
not at all, thanks though :)
varnish pre-processes its config into a c file, then compiles and runs it!

so, I am making a simple run script for uberjars
it sets a log file, finds the most up to date jar (just using sort order, but once you know that you can version appropriately) kills the current pid, starts a new one, stores its pid
I hoped there was a simple portable abstraction for this, but not really
not too bad, mostly done
just doing the basic things that tomcat was actually useful for

like auto-update is broken?
that's very weird
interesting thing about uberjar: the boot up time is actually very fast
which means I can consider using clojure for more stuff, as long as I compile to uberjars
cljx is cool
(dunno if it is much better than crossovers though)
no, not in anger
it is basically like C preprocessor macros

yeah, there is that

patchwork: the music I was talking about, where the guy claimed there was a "secret" or "hidden" beat that they were using http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ad2vYUrp5d0
the funny thing with looking up stuff like this is that there is so much amateur editing or poor archiving or miscalibrated recording that it is almost an unintentionally experimental music
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rsShtgKXDHA this one has some video (it is all over the place, but has some good chunks of the actual stuff with costumes and instruments shown)
http://i.imgur.com/cQPkJYg.gif plenty of fish in the sea
patchwork: making the testbed repo, which is based on a client site so it shouldn't be a public repo, I guess that means I should put it under instrument's gh account rather than caribou? or should we upgrade caribou to pro?
patchwork: https://github.com/Instrument/caribou-cms-testbed/tree/master/bin you can run the compile and deploy scripts to push a jar, and then use the run script on the remote host to restart with the newest jar
caveat: make a new version on the repo, make it sort after the previous alnum
I'll set up jenkins soon anyway I think, but that's what's there now

hell, they don't even make note of erlang, or make any connection between ml and haskell
I saw a great critique of unix in terms of control vs. data
it had not occured to me before that many high performance network applications are basically signal processors
so therefore usefully have the same control/data distinction you see with other DSP
ie. the reason nginx is so good is it doesn't use the OS for data, only for control
use unix functionality for config, process management, logging, but as far as data is concerned involve the OS as little as possible

there's a 3d nature film coming up
about lemurs in madagascar
with morgan freeman narrating
I want to see it in 3d, ideally with some chemical enhancement
https://www.imax.com/movies/m/island-of-lemurs-madagascar/
april 4th
the preview was amazing
lloyd has imax curved screens
but omsi is likely even better
imax
I dunno what omnimax is
ok, omnimax is on a curved dome
yeah, they have the curved screen, but not the dome
it would be nice to see the lemurs in the dome
maybe with some chemical assistance (but that is not needed of course)
https://www.omsi.edu/empirical-theater I don't see lemurs on their lineup :(
my brain is chemically implemented, but enjoys the occasional suppliment
so if they don't have omnimax anymore, may as well see it four blocks away at the lloyd cinemas on the 4th of april

I made a discovery: when I use a permanent marker to pop a balloon, the vacuum produced in the aftermath of the pop pulls a jet of permanent ink out of the pen, which shoots out and splatters whatever the pen is pointing at

I may need more experimentation to prove that this is the mechanism, but it is a good working hypothesis
and it is the case that whatever the pen was pointing at does get a blob of permanent ink on it

patchwork: a common one is to find the most rare word in the triggering statement, and then use words that correlate highly with its usage
this is where word corpuses ordered by frequency of usage become interesting
because finding correlations with the most rare input term has a high likelihood of appearing relevant
here's an algorithm: take each possible sentence, and post them all to random reddit threads. the one with the highest resulting score is most "sensible", so it is used as the result
(high latency, sadly)
maybe mechanical turk would help here
and we could cross them, and he will tell us "put your penis in the citation needed"
and "OP is a weasel word"
we could pick a forum that is less likely to cause brain damage?
or maybe just selection of subreddits would suffice

patchwork: what does the :map field on a link do?
next question: would a "make this collection/part a link" function be a useful thing to have? because as I make a migration for teague I start to think this could be generalized
cool, I'll try and generalize this, shouldn't be too bad
the complex part is capturing and recreating the existing associations on the instances
I assume we already have a "link-model-name" function that takes two model slugs as args?
(str (:slug a) "s-" (:slug b) "s") or something, but better to use the built in I am sure
cool
oh, no plurals on it
cool
and I would not have thought to sort them
nice
D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G
patchwork: and you never mentioned, what does the :map argument do in making a link?
as in the literal data being used at creation time?
ahh OK
so I want :map false if I am converting a collection
ahh cool, ok
makes sense
D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G
rotated, as usual
patchwork: almost always it starts with O
very rarely D
patchwork: I've got the collection->link as a first draft, but it feels like it's more complicated than it needs to be, got a moment to be a second pair of eyes on this?
patchwork: also, you may like this little function, let's me do C-u <font-size> M-x fonty to change font of all buffers at once: (defun fonty (n) (interactive "p") (set-default-font (concat "Inconsolata-" (prin1-to-string (if (= 1 n) 8 n)))))
of course replace "Inconsolata-" with the font name of your choice
you just do it buffer by buffer
this does it for all buffers at once
also if your desired font is a power of two in size it is easy to specify with prefix keys :)
(though any number works if you type in that number, of course)

patchwork: do I need to manually load config in my migration?
ok, I got an npe, so it may not be that
I'll just do it in a repl, no big deal
I had the syntax wrong, it's all good
it's what marketers mean when they say gigabyte, but it is more explicit

yesterday I read the book "Silence Once Begun" by Jesse Ball
I recommend it
it's a fictionalized account of a true story - 8 elderly people go missing, a man turns in a signed confession (but didn't do it - you find that out at the beginning) and is put on death row
and it's about why he confessed, and what actually happened
it goes a bunch of really unexpected places, and the authro is a poet but the language is restrained

what, dude specifically mentioned it was spangleriffic

http://vserver1.cscs.lsa.umich.edu/~crshalizi/reviews/wolfram/ he takes people to court for even *mentioning* that his trade secret proof exists
some fascinating UI in the repl in that video
I wonder how complete the implementation is
they are working on cider plugins that will do that kind of multimedia stuff
technomancy is really pushing for that kind of thing
that's what nrepl-discover is part of

patchwork: so you are more interested in the fungoid languages for example
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge
(and the many clones and variations)
the code is 2d, and various events can cause the instruction pointer to traverse it in arbitrary directions (4 in standard befunge, right left up down)
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esoteric_programming_language#Funges
http://catseye.tc/node/Trefunge-98 someone should make a 3.js debugger for this
so I am successfully making an svg entity in react... but some of the nuances are lost on me here
I think I am doing some of this wrong
it was expecting the #js macro
I have svg modified in real time inside om over here!
this will be how I create every UI from now on
so now I have a goofy proof of concept where it circles around and expands and contracts in various dimensions, it looks like a dumb version of a screensaver
that will take a while...

I think there is still some generalizing to be done with tesselact - I would like it to be a framework where you can drop in a packing algo
cool, I'll push what I have now since it is stable, and maybe have more to share later
we can totally do something more interesting
but what I have shows the bare bones of it at least
maybe a more general geometric visualizer?

actually, as anyone who has to access my host by name knows, I am kind of chaotic-neutral class wise
gen-class did the trick
right, in the top level ns

?
it's great for startup time too
yeah, I mean clojure based CLI utils seem like an option, if you compile them into an uberjars

(defn slope [{x :x y :y} {x' :x y' :y}] (/ (- y' y) (- x' x)))

by taking the reciprocal of the slope, I get the perpendicular slope, and using that I can calculate the points for the sides on the arrowhead!

https://www.facebook.com/events/1401323726797279/?ref_newsfeed_story_type=regular this looks decent
patchwork: getting closer with this arrow drawing thing, I am thinking that the slight variance I am seeing is due to the inaccuracy of the built in trig functions
OK, weird
(defn reverse-rotate [from to] (* (/ 360 Math/PI) (Math/atan (slope from to))))
works for flat, or 45 degree, slightly off in between
(defn slope [{x :x y :y} {x' :x y' :y}] (/ (- y' y) (- x' x)))
floats will just return infinity
which is the correct slope
if x' = x
and thanks to js, we know they are floats
now if x,y = x',y' it will explode
which is fair for a slope funciton
for values of "explode" ~= "returns NaN"
I know that the standard built in trig functions are not good enough for decent audio
but it is likely true they are good enough for graphics

patchwork: looks like the right fix is actually to migrate this field to be a string, since it should not be marked up
it is being used as a meta content="" data, which means no markup
right, string remains unmarked up
I guess people think string means plain text and text means marked up? kinda makes sense, I thought it was a length thing
complected!
also, lunch

so yeah, I'll make a migration on that shit

patchwork: they were talking about security issues in many (most? all?) of the clojure templating libs
#clojure
anyway, it may be interesting to consider if antlers could be shown to be secure(able), and what changes that may require
default behaviors in regards to usage of request input and the functions called on them leading to arbitrary code execution or DOS
patchwork: I don't know if or that antlers has any issues - what I was suggesting is figuring out how we would *prove* it does or doesn't
and the next step would be considering a secured version I guess? It's a legitimate concern
well, sure, but there are best practices
and for example with crypto, you can have "epsilon from certainty" kind of stuff
"if P!=NP this is secure"
yeah, we could maybe define "safe helpers" as an option
and consider which ones could be made safer

OK never mind making plugins backward compatible with weareinstrumentv3's version of caribou, let's make weareinstrumentv3 use the newer caribou instead
I forgot about the handler definition annoyance :P
patchwork: also, I can't get a synthesized response to be anything but plain, html, or json as a content type - something in caribou is forcing the content type to be plain if I provide anything else
any idea where that would be happening?
by synthesized I mean that the ring wrap-files middleware provides good content types, but if I have a page that returns rss, it won't let me specify an rss content type
it's happening in handler/handler
patchwork: yeah, problem persists with wrap-content-type commented out, I will chase it through handler/handler
patchwork: also I cleaned some stuff up in weareinstrumentv3 so that lein check would run and pass, we should run lein check before commiting code, and keep repos in a state where lein check passes.

did I mention rss is handled fine by caribou, it is chrome that was making it return text/plain via accept-encoding? what a wild goose chase
it seems that since the demise of google reader, chrome hates rss and refuses to do anything sensible with it
right, but the default behavior when you hit an rss feed is to show you some xml as plain text
which makes the naïve rss-feed developer think he has made a mistake of some sort

got all that js stuff figured out, now trying to figure out how to update teague to the upgraded admin version...
I think I have the next part sorted out

patchwork: officially giving up on updating teague to a newer caribou for now, too much frontend shit breaking and I have no frontend guy
now I am going to backport the js and template changes to the working version of teague
12 -> 14
yeah, probably, I just need to wrap this crap up but I think I have sane path forward now
http://comonad.com/reader/2014/letter-to-a-young-haskell-enthusiast/ looks like someone in haskell-land got tired of bitemyapp (or one of his clones)
it's a good article
so, for some reason I thought it would be easier to just upgrade teague to a newer caribou, where I had added the features
(not to mention being the *right thing*)
turns out it was much easier to copy and paste the required changes :(
at least I am getting it done now

speaking of trapped
http://vlazzarini.github.io/

but it has a bunch of nice csound in js demos
since it is clean portable c it compiled down to pnacl nicely
not all plugins are ported (not all plugins are portable) but a decent range are there
yeah, it is pretty huge
one dream of mine is cljs + that could kick overtone all over the block and back again :)

yeah, pretty much
I just spent the weekend getting some programming lessons from James Reeves (aka weavejester, the guy who wrote ring and compojure)
I had a pr against clj-aws-s3, which was really shitty (but working) code, and he gave me some really excellent feedback for improving the code to be up to snuff
quile: also, I recall we had some discussion in the past about an ex of yours who had bpd?
turns out my (very recently) ex had bpd
and it fucking exploded (leading to our breakup)
yeah
she is the only person I have had to block on facebook
things were up and down, but seemed workable, until one day I said I needed some space and asked if I could be alone that afternoon....
and that triggered her abandonment issues... and then things got really fucked up
heh
I ended up getting a hotel room
because she refused to leave my house
finally I figured out how to get her out without escalating the craziness or getting the police involved: I finally found a friend of hers that she had not totally alienated, and had that friend come to my apartment and help her pack up and leave
while taking her side against me
I got my keys back, and thanks to being on the second floor with a locked door on the first, I feel safe :)
I have her screened on my phone, email, facebook
she publically accused me of being abusive
the "abuse" consisting of me remembering the multiple times I told her to leave my apartment (she does not remember any of those conversations) and my turning the ac off when I left
so of course that means I am gaslighting her and trying to make her think she is crazy by inventing interactions that did not happen, and I was trying to kill her by leaving her alone in a stuffy apartment with no ac...
the absurd thing is she is not an idiot, she could have figured out how to turn the ac on - I was just turning it off because I was leaving, and I did not trust her to remember to turn it off when she left
and of course it was fully in her power to leave any time she wanted
but anyway, I called some friends of hers, the friends packed up her things and gave me back my keys without me having to deal with her (and the situation would have escalated if I dealt with her directly)
it's a big feeling of relief to be out of the situation
heh, sure thing!
one of the core csound devs is making an audio synthesis language in pure clojure
yeah, I look forward to playing with it, and hopefully making significant contributions
in the immediate aftermath of the breakup, it felt like my brain was mostly gone - I am slowly getting my cognitive faculties back...
quile: did you also see my character-based markov chain lib?
it has a configurable memory size, and a seedable rng for reproducing results
unexpected upside to the breakup: I had been reluctant to get better headphones, but to get my nice headphones back I would have to deal with the crazy again - so instead I get better headphones :)
I can highly recommend the sennheiser hd25 ii - not as perfectly flat as the sennheiser hd380 pro, but much more portable and much lighter weight
and all the parts are user servicable / replacible
to get something as portable / durable as the hd25 ii and as flat as the hd380 would have been very very expensive, so it's a decent tradeoff

boo is right
also, the ex had a friend of hers reach out to me to talk about getting together with her therapist so I could "take accountability"
which is such a fucking crock of shit
I can't even
fucking a, I am sorry to hear it
her ego is so fragile, she can't process conflict without making someone else out to be fully responsible for her unhappiness
because her only available options are to see herself as perfect, and see herself as worthless and not even deserving to exist
she is just trying to keep away the latter judgement, which she is constantly ready to make about herself
but that doesn't make this bullshit any less bulshit
the ability to analyze relationship dynamics from a cold distance is my blessing and my curse
*less ability than "constant state of being" I guess

excellently done
from the related https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OnlsfeRNw1I
proper performance starts around 5:00
amazing grace was maybe chosen because it is a favorite for shape-note
and shape-note has similar tonal constraints to an ensemble of hundreds of theremins
yeah, shape note is inherently pentatonic (but very weirdly notated / weird orchestration rules)
like - the structure as written is pentatonic, but a given performance will typically have harmonies that are impossible with a pentatonic scale, because there are no actual defined pitches in shape note
shape note version of amazing grace - a bit more cacaphonous than the theremins were actually https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uPOo4dOuPbQ

so, I finally borked the screen on my cell phone
the one I had for 6 years
I did that thing where I throw it at the ground to demonstrate I can just put it back together and everything is fine...
but the screen is damaged :(
I did it so many times though!
it's even gotten me laid!
so I ordered a new nokia, should be here shortly
not a smart phone, but is fancy enough to have shit like a camera and mp3 playback
it can even run j2me apps - I may even try compiling one for shits and giggles
I was picturing maybe a textual client that connects to a clojure app on an ec2 instance via tcp, and does things like logging info I want to look at later from a real computer, or getting me a low bandwidth text feed out of a web page to minimize data plan usage
could be a fun little hack
ie. send it "google a b c" and it returns with 1 "summary" 2 "summary2" etc. and then I tell it which page to get out of the summaries it sends me
and I get said page in minimal compressed form, obviously
but yeah, I'll finally be living in the '90s, phone tech wise
I looked online, at the apps available, the popular ones (other than games) were things like "ultimate pashto to english dictionary" "the best urdu to english dictionary" and "portable digital koran"
with some improved design, yeah
I think it just displays things, rather than being a debugger as schmetterling is
yeah, it's not doing any of the dt-socket stuff
it doesn't stop the process or allow in-frame eval
it's just a pretty printer for exceptions
I saw "under the skin" - it really surprised me, excellent film
reminded me of the best things about the '70s, when movies could really take chances
oh, so under the skin is a scarllet johanson movie, from scottland
sci fi, based on a book
very abstract
D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G
patchwork: it's only an exception pretty printer
it does no debugging
oh - maybe I am wrong
looks like an exception handler that captures locals https://github.com/magnars/prone/blob/master/src/prone/debug.clj
not interactive though
patchwork: no jdi, just a fancy ass exception handler that captures locals https://github.com/magnars/prone/blob/master/src/prone/prep.clj#L105
one could add this feature set for showing context / the nice parts of the UI, to the schmetterling debugging features ftw
patchwork: I got a halfway-decent viola
I realized my electric just doesn't have the texture an acoustic can get
it all comes down to my ex not giving my nice headphones back - so I got even better ones - and now I can hear stuff in recordings that is making me reevaluate some timbral stuff
yeah, the electric is very smooth, this acoustic is so I have more variety with the rougher stuff
D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G
yeah, I actually helped him out quite a bit
he forked my aws / s3 library fork
he went and did this other thing in cljs beyond that though
it was thanks to his work that caribou/clj-aws-s3 got submitted upstream for a pr (and then I learned about james reeves' high code standards)

tomorrow night, there is a Stuart Dempster concert
Annie and I are going
trombone drone ambient music / deep listening https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mXd0o0_tHo

it's tomorrow night at YU

I have a portable headphone amp coming in the mail in the next hour
so excited
provides extra power - higher quality headphones tend to work better with a more powerful signal
also, it takes a direct digital in from my portable music player, so it serves as a replacement DAC (higher quality, of course)
and it also works as a USB connected external sound card (output only)
has a built in adjustable EQ as well
regarding the higher power being needed - it's simple physics - headphones are a passive device (they can only modify the input by attenuating it) - so if they need to balance some acoustic property of the structure / materials / components they are made of, that balancing can only be done by reducing some parts of the signal until the response is even
I got some good phones, they just sound better with more power - which I now have
but also this allows me to upgrade to even more power hungry phones, if I ever wish to
it attaches via an optical cable, and has its own battery
has a rubber band to attach it to the music player
it's about the form factor of a typical ipod, slightly smaller
(just opened the box :))
this model can also connect to an iphone digitally and act as the default soundcard there too
now I just need to wait for the battery to charge...
lol
patchwork: speaking of awesome sci-fi, have you seen Under The Skin yet?
yeah, with the gain turned up, I get much more bass response, even at lower volumes
sweet
yeah, it's excellent
shades of kubrik / jodorovsky
very abstract, allegorical, phantasmogoric, frequently confusing
have you guys seen the new features coming up for clojure 1.7?
yeah, there are transducers, and also a version of warn-on-reflection that warns about numeric boxing
yeah, it's a very brittle toolchain
we need higher standards for tooling out there in general
lein had a release recently that totally broke for non-project repls - which is a scenario that is typical to a brand new user
how many potential clojure users did we alienate with that I wonder?
it was just totally broken, with 100% useless error message and stack trace (well, useful for a lein implementor, not at all to a lein user)
oh my fucking god!
so I have these recordings of beethoven's string quartets I have been listening to regularly for about a year now
my OMFG is that I heard birds singing in the background
I am totally sold on this amp / these headphones - amazing
patchwork: kind of an audio microscope - or upgrading to cochlea resolution (to borrow the "retina" metaphor from apple)
that is, any details finer than what this setup exposes to me are probably inaudible anyway :)
D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G D O G
so, I learned today that clojure 1.7 transducers can abstract over the java 8 Stream API
giving a way to map or reduce or filter (or chain such operations) with far less resource usage
yeah, 1.7 is still alpha
the idea is it composes maps / filters / reduces / etc. into a single action that does not need the input to be a collection, and does not produce intermediate lazy sequences between the steps
(comp (partial filter even?) (partial map inc)) creates two lazy sequences - the transducing version (comp (filter even?) (map inc)) produces only one - and if you add a reduce (comp (reduce +) (filter even?) (map inc)) it produces no intermediate sequence at all
also the fact that (filter even?) returns a transducing function is pretty cool, and intuitive
no, not currying
it is a new arity, that returns a transducing function
transducers can be applied to sequential things, to java streams, or to core.async channels
and can use all of them directly without needing to create a sequence first
turns out I need to get a new sim card - for the first time ever I will have a data plan!
I think I will write a j2me app that connects to a clojure evaluation server just for shits and giggles (this device can do j2me, but not proper mobile apps)
this prone demo is pretty cool https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/3378230/prone-demo.mp4
patchwork: I spent some time looking at it, never really used it
but yeah, graph dbs are awesome as far as I am concerned
very nice
heh
probably one of those "dark enlightenment" types
lol http://i.qkme.me/3vb225.jpg
http://i.imgur.com/wdeXIfa.jpg I can relate
ugh. Can't use the data plan with my new phone because key parts of the UI are in japanese with no English translation. Or maybe it is impossible to set this part of the phone's configuration.

I think someone was curious to hear it, downloaded, didn't like it, and now it is just there, like herpes, forever
it's been a while since we three have met to lunch and set curses upon a Scottish king.
patchwork: check it, generic text search for teague https://www.refheap.com/90071
rule of thumb: if the music has a part where someone excitedly exclaims "bass!" it has been mastered with reduced bass content, because the target audience listens to music with their bass turned up excessively high, and normal bass levels would sound like shit
oh, well that would be nice enough

caribou docs broke.
https://caribou.github.io/caribou/docs/outline.html
well - not totally broken, but loads really slowly and shows up unstyled
ahh! it's being broken by https
we have http resources accessed within a https page, and things break
wow, care to get me in touch?
I think I have some pretty decent Clojure credentials :)
yeah, I am definitely interested
patchwork: https://caribou.github.io/caribou/docs/outline.html breaks because it is https and is pulling in http resources from other sites
should we just make it be http? (is that possible?) should we change the resource links to be protocol relative?
that's the link I get from google
when I google for caribou docs
I think there is a link on the main caribou page to https too
where it links to the docs
anyway, other people are definitely finding these https links, if my least effort path led me to them
let me backtrack
I could have gotten it from a defunct source
patchwork: how do I bust the caribou query cache?
just reset or swap on the atom?
heh, I thought so too
I will keep looking
they wanted a feature where a new item is the first position wise, which means updating other positions when items are created
turns out this is an order of magnitude or more faster to do with raw sql rather than caribou operations, I just need to inform caribou that the element cache is out of date
that's a bigger change - we still need sorting by position because of the other features
*want
sorting by position is extremely convenient and intuitive here
"update element set position = position+1 where 1" is easy and fast
no conditionals, the db super-optimizes it
and it doesn't fit the existing caribou abstractions at all, of course
I don't need to get any data about elements to do it
this is a hook in teague
specific to the behaviors they need in their admin UI
(for my retainer)
if this comes up a second time, we could make a setting such that position descends vs. ascends. Position can be a negative number (which could be another way I could handle this I guess)

should be listed under background / projects I guess?

patchwork: did you see? apple created an app specifically for deleting the free U2 album
maybe more of an api endpoint than app? it's a dedicated tool just for deleting that one album

TIL ios8 has a built in multiple-choice markov generator

quile: https://twitter.com/KimKierkegaard/status/512991184592306176 something I was mentioning last we hung out
http://kathyack.tumblr.com/ another one
https://twitter.com/PLT_Hulk/status/511576053194973184 lol
quile: thanks again for checking in with the Australian folks, I look forward to hearing from them
I just had someone reach out from factual (where amalloy, ztellman, and aphyr work)
I would be starstruck to be working with those guys - but it would be either remote, or moving to CA
yeah
I guess for working remote, CA is not too bad, because the occasional visits would be short trips
yeah - it's not a guaranteed position, and I would prefer something without travel at all - but it's an interesting option
quile: saw that email, thanks
patchwork: I watched the rich hickey transducer talk from strangeloop (it is on youtube) and was reminded of a covnersation you and I had ages ago
patchwork: hickey explains transducers from the point of view that a reduce is a primitive operation, out of which map, fold, mapcat, etc. can be built
patchwork: a big part of what transducers do is flip the clojure abstraction stack, and instead of putting sequences at the bottom, putting reduce at the bottom
patchwork: idea being, you can do everything by converting to the common abstraction of lazy-seq, but this creates and immediately discards sequences you don't really need
quile: patchwork: meeting with them on Tuesday, looks promising
patchwork: but they are not seq operations any more at all
patchwork: they could be ops on a channel
patchwork: it dissociates the data source from the algorithm entirely
exactly
patchwork: funny thing is, this was my first intuition (erroneous) of how things in clj would work, so it is awesome to see things actually being done this way
quile: network as in communications or as in graphs? (both are cool)
patchwork: the mention of neo4j made me think it could be either :)
sounds like a good use case for titanium
wait, not titanium - I am misremembering the name
OK, this titanium http://titanium.clojurewerkz.org/articles/getting_started.html
patchwork: well, titanium is a) in process and b) in memory rather than on disk
b is optional, and a depends on the storage backend, but...
patchwork: I haven't used either in anger, but have curiously poked at a bunch of things
patchwork: weird, I never have that issue
https://github.com/fog/fog/issues/9 lol
patchwork: ran into a weird caribou bug - using a repl inside a caribou app, trying to interrupt a function that was in a tight loop, we got banned from the mysql server because we were making too many new connections too fast
patchwork: will have to sort out what parts of this led to this issue (and also reset the mysql server to let me in again)
yeah, tell me about it
the nrepl wrapper caribou uses by default creates a new db connection per execution
so maybe something was hammering requests to the nrepl server

awesome talk about coordinated distributed state https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QdkS6ZjeR7Q
why did nobody think of this before http://techcrunch.com/2010/07/20/idish-the-ipad-as-a-plate-for-sushi-steaks-and-dessert/
heh
the problem with that talk was it was organized around delivering comic insults to the target audience
if you already use a type safe language, then the talk isn't really here or there
if you don't they are talking shit about you
I did enjoy the dig about all the shity ruby devs that are now shitty clojure devs
definitely a thing!
yeah, in a bit over an hour
excited
also I got a CD of solo viola (arad, bach, corigliano, waggoner, stravinsky, prestini, penderecki) that I have been looking forward to listening to
I have been looking at some haskell development screencasts, and the tooling is so terrible compared to clojure...
the whole thing where all the docs are like "you don't need verbiage describing this library, the type signatures are all you need" is so weird...
also, the fact that nothing implements Show by default...
I was noticing that haskell devs tend to underestimate their competence, and for example, ruby or php devs over-estimate how much they understand.
After some consideration, I decided it would help to have a very polite haskell.
"sorry, I don't quite get what you were getting at on line 7. Maybe you meant that to be a Functor?"
"clearly this compiler just isn't clever enough for your code, do us a favor and clarify the fixity of this function..."
oh, of course
right, php will gladly pretend you knew what you were doing
which is what led to my polite haskell idea
the Contrition monad
patchwork: for sure

ever have that feeling that instead of turning down the weird you just changed the weird channel
so this is something those silverpond guys are doing http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS
it's like discoverability for REST
patchwork: meta-spec is REST
patchwork: and the endpoints give the extra data so you can walk the whole site of services like a tree
or that's the theory
well, not just like a tree, it is a tree of services with hyperlinks for pointers
another thing he mentioned was thin client web stuff, where the server sends DOM manipulation commands direct to the client - which sounds super sketch to me
patchwork: hardly anyone uses it, dunno if it works in practice
one of the actions is that the server can send code to the client that helps it navigate new content types
perhaps this includes the hateoas structure itself
it's embedded in the response, but yeah, you would have client side code, likely some js on the initial landing page I guess?
patchwork: that would connect these two concepts
it was a good discussion, I didn't get the impression I would be likely to get work from them though
but sometimes I misread people, so we'll see
I didn't get the feeling at the end of the meeting that I would be getting any work offers.
yeah, I can be excessively self critical sometimes (especially when any sort of cultural boundry is being crossed). We'll see.

patchwork: I didn't even make it to the Coltrane thing last night, sadly. I stayed home and implemented the base-;lkjfdsa-encoding instead
it's a mostly useless algorithm that converts any 7-bit-clean plaintext to look like someone was poinding on the home row of their keyboard like a jackass
yes, it goes both ways, one moment
full code https://www.refheap.com/90612
wasn't really worth a github repo yet
it's kind of like steganography, but instead of hiding the text as an image, it hides it as pointless adolescent keyboard pounding
same concept though
haha
I talked to technomancy about generalizing it for dvorak, or planets where people have finger counts that are not a power of 2

(apply str (map {\a "Wake up sheeple! " \b "911 was an inside job. " \c "The moon landing was faked. " \d "Worst video evar"} input))

so how about that bash thing huh?
crazy shit
I feel sorry for the folks running CGI sites on old redhat boxes...
no, just people who have bash as the system shell, and run processes that use a remote env
debian / ubuntu use dash, so we are fine
because bash is full of weird features nobody actually uses
so the people who were like "I know lets import an environment var from the net" were totally disconnected from the ones who were like "I know, lets connect environment vars to executing arbitrary code"
it's the classic convenience vs. security dilemma, and in the space of bad design, you through disorganized and obscure features at convenience problems, leading to security holes
*you throw
which is why it makes sense to minimize your feature set at abstraction barriers - which makes me think I should hurry up and learn haskell because lisps are terrible about this stuff :) full of obscure features with bizarre unintended overlapping implications
heh
yeah, j5 put the api key for instagram in the js
no big surprise, the key is no longer valid (may have been abused, who knows)
now I have to figure out how to a) access the instagram api from the backend and forward to the frontend or b) how to allow anonymous access on the frontend
I think the current situation is likely not even kosher with the instagram TOS

I have discovered that the terrible thing that is clicker games are: a) a reductio ad absurdum of all games that contain "grinding" b) much more about waiting for cool things to happen, and coming back to the game hours later after it farmed some shit.

woah, john brown made an awesome thing http://codepen.io/ThisIsJohnBrown/pen/cqmrv
quile: https://twitter.com/timbaldridge/status/516647993844305920
I've definitely learned a lot from him
quile: so sorting out this auth token in the js bs: turns out instagram only allows authenticated access to a specific user's feed, so the only clean way is to proxy the api and provide the token from the backend (once we get a new token that works again)
my fear: someone scraped the access token out of the js and abused it nefariously which is what got it cancelled
more likely: instagram noticed their api was being used ina way they don't like (which would be a problem that would come up again even usign the token on the backend)

so I tried one of those silly "clicker" games - they are basically mini games that simulate the "farming" experience in grind-heavy video games
cookie clicker - turns out that there is not much clicking involved - mostly letting it run and watching it evolve, then clicking a few options
but the reason I mention cookie clicker now is that it turns into a bizarre psychedelic nightmare if you let it run lock enough
I was impressed
patchwork: things you run into end up including a pan-grandmother hive mind, and creatures from another dimension that nibble all your cookies, and deliver them back to you when popped
ostensibly about cookies
then it gets more and more weird...

quile: how about "I responded to your preceding anecdote, quip, pun, or link with an audible guffaw, or at least a noticable exhale of air that in our internet age we qualify as "a laugh"."
Speaking of waxing prolix, I have been rereading Samuel Beckett's Mollow, and discovered the following passage: "This time, then once more I think, then perhaps a last time, then I think it'll be over, with that world too."
it led me to believe that Beckett was grinding out levels in World of Warcraft
or perhaps the tedium of repetitive but addicting video games is like the misery of a life lived too long
very likely
patchwork: or maybe most of the potential Becketts of his day wasted their time with poker, whist, rummy, and the horses, and the only difference is ease of access and speed of reward
this has long been my suspicion
an old friend, the man who first made me learn linux, and introduced me to programming, and introduced me to higher math, recently reached out to me
he loves theater (especially the avant garde) but has been retreating into playing MUDs
and given what he taught me, he could easily have a career better than I have had, but instead he is isolated, unproductive...
I think this is about deeper issues too (the things he retreats from and tries to cope with by turning to repetitive addicting games)

via nginx, silly
OK
yesterday I made a bunch of progress trying to proxy an api call that was being one in the js, so we don't leak auth credentials to the frontend
also, I got sql based search (pick a model, get all instances with a matching text / string field for query) working
I have been experimenting with haskell
and wasting some time with stupid games (coming out of that)
wait, what about auth?
yeah, the right way to handle it is an ssl layer on nginx I think
no, the js was using a third party API, and had our auth token embedded in the js
patchwork: sad thing is we had that consensus, and never did proceed to wrap anything in ssl
I was thinking about the whole docker thing the other day - to me the history goes like this: 1) libraries are archives unpacked in your dev directory 2) so much waste of disk space and ram! shared libraries and shared headers 3) dependency hell between various projects 4) disk space is cheap, let's just install an operating system running on a virtual machine for each project
where really - to some degree we could just stick with "dependencies per project" and skip the complexity, right?
patchwork: did you end up trying that graphing technique?
patchwork: also, did you notice that instrument dropped caribou for squarespace?
yeah, of course they prune the image - but it's still installing an entire working OS in order to avoid duplicating dev deps...
absolutely not
it's also a way to avoid having any *nix knowledge (or minimize it) by being able to simply push an image
of course
patchwork: it goes a little deeper than I may have made clear
the whole "isolating dev deps" thing
for example, shared libraries make these things hard
people release binary incompatible versions of the same version lib
but not using shared libraries at all is still cheaper resource wise than pervasive use of VMs is
hmm
I think it's a convenient solution to an old, bad, design
but the right solution is simpler but would be a bigger cultural shift
kind of
with no shared libraries, and dependencies managed by per-project management tools rather than per-system, something like docker would only be needed in very large, highly automated setups
not just shared libs
shared anything
:)
library artifacts, library source, binaries, various configuration
the thing is, the success of docker shows we can afford that level of isolation
and a shared-nothing-by-default approach has more flexibility
right
to some degree that's the point of a kernel, anyway
it's just that we have a bunch of legacy shortcuts that were great for reducing resource usage once upon a time...
hmm
well, even docker doesn't abstract from OS - you need an image compatible with a vm container for your OS
I think I am spoiled in that I don't see that problem very often, since I run the same OS I deploy to
it makes me very happy that this exists https://hackage.haskell.org/package/acme-dont-1.1/docs/Acme-Dont.html
very elementary stuff, refreshing my previous very elementary stuff :)
I'll let you know as soon as it is anything interesting
definitely not - I've been making a point to take breaks to read actual books
and I've been playing music, a bit
no, haven't followed up yet
definitely will

patchwork: kevin drumm is playing at YU tonight https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hlizdOqSbcM
I met him when I was a 19 year old kid in chicago
one of the few people of my acquaintance to get regular reviews in pitchfork
he does a mix of ambient drone and harsh noise drone, but his latest album was very ambient and quiet, so that is likely how this show will be
some teague work, learning haskell, reading (beckett and algorithms), spinning up an idea for a ring adaptor that isn't a web server, but takes a string and returns one
patchwork: yeah, that would be cool
what about the Indian place on Burnside? I haven't been there in ages.
they replaced that wall!
can she replace the vehicle?
I actually got a chance to talk to the guys replacing the wall, the were impressed by the story of the crash
lol

quile: so that guy who I was mentioning yesterday, whose show I went to last night? he remembered me
I was so flattered
also, a top-notch noise show
he and I have been moving in similar directions since 1995 or so when I first went to one of his shows
though he has things like a record label and positive reviews in pitchfork magazine... I'm happy for him

turns out, I still love the kind of noisy shit he does
difference being it's now pretty close to what I do too
very inspiring
it was intense
oh, and to top it all off, among his gear was the first pedal I helped Dan Green invent!
he was shocked I had anything to do with that
I liked his stuff years ago, but my attention span was much shorter - he tends to elaborate things much more slowly

oh shit
quile: how about adding "let's turn the board around" as well

and as is being discussed on #clojure at this moment, transducers make programming for core.async even better
quile: the latest supports them, if you are using clj 1.7 at least
or so I hear...
quile: yeah, people were talking about updating and getting deprecation warnings for the chan map function etc. (to use a transducer instead)
quile: so I was "discussing" a design with this madman on #clojure - a php / perl guy who is trying to make a "scripting framework" for clojure
so insane
not to say his being a perl guy caused the madness, of course
for whatever godawful reason, he is using gensym to create the names of functions, and then mapping across all functions in a namespace and executing them if they have a :script metadata...
like OMGWTF
gensym to create function names?!?!?!
I was like dude, if the names are not important, just make an array of functions
he was like "I guess that would have worked too"
patchwor`: he wants to take function definitions from a client, and create handlers from them on the server side, as some kind of interactive live update of the server thingymajig
patchwor`: so I guess gensym insures they don't clobber other functions of the same name? totally bonkers
quile: that's what I gather
patchwor`: not only can you, that works out better too
patchwor`: he really seemed to be fond of overly complex / overengineered OO / j2ee style constructs, and highly suspicious of standard clojure ways of doing things
patchwor`: I think he may be the antihickey
the antihickey, as the prophecies foretold
patchwor`: the power of confusion and anti-pragmatism :)
spreads it by example and contagion
oh, and lack of thinking / designing before implementing
also, I found my new favorite putdown gif for programming language / library / design style misfeatures http://i.imgur.com/MdbUlkO.png

patchwor`: have you heard of this game? http://www.shutupandsitdown.com/blog/post/review-dog-eat-dog/
and intense
patchwor`: we did not grow up in a society that rationalizes the sides of that game and makes excuses for the unfairness in it?

quile: helping raynes out with updating lazybot to the newest irclj version
first step was to log in with the old one to verify my local setup (worked)
now to use the new irclj properly (not working at all)
indeed
opal is so special https://github.com/jashkenas/coffeescript/wiki/list-of-languages-that-compile-to-js
(in all seriousness, that list of things that compile to js is kind of amazing)
hello, patchwork
I spent some time trying to help Raynes update lazybot to the latest irclj
(will likely work on it some more later)
it's in my scrollback, but it's all just nonsense
nope, it's the new one
I'll need to look at how you handle the hook functions (they broke with the lib upgrade in lazybot)
beat you to it :)
yeah, he is not getting one of the basics that tells him to do things like joining chans I guess
it could be that certain joining behaviors that were once implicit are now explicit
I'll have to return to this later

I don't like holidays because there is a social imperative to be a child. I felt this way even when I was a child.
being a child was miserable, adults constantly pressuring you to have "fun"
patchwork: I frankly don't even know any more
I'm probably just in a shitty mood
right
I think the key might be that I had a very open ended and permissive upbringign, which was generally very free and indulgent, but suddenly holidays came around where there were all these stupid expectations and I had to play this pre-scripted role that I was usually able to avoid
so it's not that holidays were bad, they were just my rare glimpse of "normality", which I did not like
anyway, I'll feel better, and be less self-indulgent, after some coffee
absolutely
today is special because 1000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000201410310000000000000000000000000000001 is a prime number with the date in the middle
but clearly not special enough to be numerwang
quile: oh yeah, I keep forgetting that
One of these days, I will get a numberwang.
again, I will get it again
I have gotten a few
quile: someone on #clojure is asking about cljs on node, he is asking about repos with examples etc.
no biggie
just that a dude was curious, figured you may have input
quile: no, just mentioned "I know someone"
and figured if you wanted to talk to him you could
quile: the guy was named txgruppi
one question that came up, and now I am curious: what was the criteria for using node / cljs - the requirements of the client?
surely not more relaible than the jvm?
right
one gotcha with clojure / jvm is the permgen issue - clojure generates more classes than java by far
and java will never create a temporary class

I have done redhat
as I recall, the issue with your server had to do with permissions, the user was being granted access to the audio device when logged in to the physical machine, but not when logged in remotely (which is usually a fair thing)

let me know if / when you want an update
will be going out to get some coffee in a minute or two
OK
turns out sox does not play very nicely with alsa, and oss does not play very nicely with high channel count
there are two we are ignoring, but the interface is picky we have to open all 12
well, the thing is it also doesn't do implicit format conversion, and the card has very limited format support
they have 12 known inputs
some of them we clearly are not using
I think at least two are direct digital ins with no adc
anyway, so the cards are picky - they only let you open all 12 channels
and the only sr supported is 8k or 48k
and the only sample format supported is 32 bit signed ints
of course
just updating on the particulars
so the code is not written for 32 bit signed
would it be easier to change code for 32 bit, or resample in sox?
well we could also do 8k
cool
OK, my current process is defining the shell code that takes one arecord and uses tee to pipe it to 10 instances of sox
oh you should see the feature I logged in to demo
(inc Double)
(inc mongodb)
(inc clojure)
you get the idea
(inc Float)
it's a silly feature in inc
(dec mongodb)
(dec mongodb)
so, back to business
quile: well sox would separate one channel out of each multi channel stream
I was misled, one sox instance can have only one output
the example for splitting channels did not work with streaming input
quile: maybe, but would we want to? arecord is only able to open all 12 channels
it cannot do it piecemeal, the card does not support it
that simplifies it slightly
I will try that, dmix may help
right
instead of building N of them at once using tee
I got into a shell quoting hell
right
exactly
another option is to coordinate the streams from clojure which has better syntax for higher order stuff, ProcBuilder is something I have used to great success
it gives you inputstreams / outputstreams of each thing, which you can wire together
quile: that's the problem
I will try again, but oss is only giving sox 2 channels
and alsa was being a bitch
so I think my priorities are: try sox for some $T, if it never works, go back to arecord and piping
quile: yes arecord uses alsa
it is the sox/alsa thing that fucks up
in fact sox's preferred backed, oss, is just an emulation layer on alsa at this point
no, that is not something you get outside of pro audio patching
which is another route I think I mentioned...
hmm - there is a jack command to dump output
but you would stil lneed sox
it's worth another alsa/sox try though I think
no, sox is not a hog at all
compared to clojure it's a fly
cool, I hope to wrap this up soon, some instrument stuff needs attending to and I refuse to multitask
refuse is a strong word : I massively lose productivity when I multitask
righto
quile: main thing is I will need verification that the format is still good after running through sox
quile: is there a good way to test this? like a known input/output I could compare to?
quile: if you figure out a script that will feed a file to sox | maudio and dump to another file, so I can compare for identical output, that would be kickass
quile: cool - still have the multiplexing on broadcaster to do but that should be straightforward
quile: if you know what they should look like at least :) I may need your help at that stage
OK, off to get coffee and then jump into this shit
cool, but I was digging that whole terrorist cell / mafia / espionage "only know who you need to know" dealy
(joking)
spoc always reminded me of illicit doings
you want client input? I know a guy
patchwork: check it
(dec mongodb)
quile: it's the standard lazybot karma system
you use it to give or take very important ego determining internet points
because it's silly
(dec Double)
I think anybot needs to go
too much silliness
really???
hmm??
@will the fun ever end?
quile: is the nerve number animal, vegetable, mineral, pill, injection?
I fucking hate sox right now
actually I think I just got it
I just had to griple
lol
or not...
quile: both input and output were name -
so I was trying to fix the format specification for one of them
given the name -
and forgot that the OTHER one may not be properly specified!
nearly fixed
yeah, I was just misreading the error
forgot both input and output were named -
so trying to fix the wrong end
nearly got it
quile: OK all those files are produced, my code is all up on github in master, the file contents can be checked
let me know if anything is unclear of course
depending on verification I hope to knock out the clj before EOD tomorrow so I can get on the instrument stuff
quile: yeah, twelve fingerprints from one card
will just need to change the file output to fifo output, and make sure broadcaster is reading the fifos
well let's wait for some vfication, but thanks :)
I think runner ended up in a very reasonable state given the amount of craziness it is pulling with data streams :)
https://github.com/juked/kantar-demo/blob/master/runner#L39 check it, lol
oh shit, comment errata
yeah, if you consider all of those redirects happening twelve times, thats like - hella streams going on
right, with names that match up, of course
thanks
that's like a compressed kernel of shell - only a hint of the amount of work that went into it, heh
for a while I was trying to use a loop to construct the lines of that alsa_stream function - bad news, quoting hell
quile: processed is not binary data...
raw is
0x00 should be silence
can you get other raw files to play?
I mean is this because they are raw? do you want me to log in and make them into wav files?
because I can totally do that
I just generated the wavs
quile: I forget that other people don't frequently treat random blobs of data as audio files lol
awesome
yeah, for triggers he is
$PING
$ping
err
@PING
@ping
I forget he doesn't have the usual lazybot prefix
patchwork: ping
-patchwork: ping
woah, this math trick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJf8XAhC550
quile: absolutely
but what I like the most is that the process of drawing the lines helps someone who is a visual thinker to better understand what multiplication *is*
a lot of "tricks" for math don't offer that kind of insight
that combinatorial aspect
quile: so, taking a look at broadcaster for real now, I think I can just add a "stream" argument to start-realtime-stream, and loop through opening each relevant input stream. Or start all the processes from within clojure and grab their output streams directly, but that may be excessively clever / less intuitive to a future programmer.
so yeah, one fifo for each data stream
and start-reference-stream would run start-realtime-stream once for each of these
right
it's the same interface, so the jvm promises it will just work
in fact *in* is just a file on linux anyway
right
and probably to emit some signal that it has all fifos open and ready - because of how finicky audio devices are it's better to have something waiting to read before you start up the part connected to the device
right
right
simple simple
I'd rather not do it tonight, brain is kind of used up
by the way it feels really great to be doing this kind of work - I have fucked with this kind of thing for so long but it feels nice to be doing it as a professional thing
hell yeah
also, this is definitely better quality clojure code than you led me to expect
cool
that keeps getting me
heh, I remember that convo
only bikeshed I have had to do so far: turning (doall (map ...)) into (doseq ...)
woah, binary->hex is doing a lot more work than it needs to - but I'll leave it alone for now
so - is a command line arg, originally right?
OK, yeah, I'll have to mess with that a bit, totally tractable though
it's OK I am sure
it's just making a hex number from those digits right?
ahh, unsigned hex from those bits?
still, there are tools that make that simpler (and more CPU efficient)
not a priority
,(format "%x" (first (reduce (fn [[d count] b] [(+ d (bit-shift-left b count)) (inc count)]) [0 0] [1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1]))) ; one liner
,(format "%x" (first (reduce (fn [[d count] b] [(+ d (bit-shift-left b count)) (inc count)]) [0 0] (map {\1 1 \0 0} (remove #{\space} "1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1")))))
ie. with a let block and names to the parts of it
quile: absolutely sure it isn't an issue, I am just fucking around at this point
and taking a deeper look, Integer/parseInt % 2 is a good way to do it
just less "clever"
so not as fun to make a one liner for
oh I know it
I even fucked with tcl quite a bit
right
ever look at golfscript?
implemented in haskell, it's an imperative stack based language optimized for tersness
so it has higher order functional constructs, just because said constructs help make code short
it only supports one letter variable names iirc
and because of this everything can be squashed in with no spaces
http://www.golfscript.com/golfscript/examples.html
I mean look at that fucking sudoku solver...
"77 bytes, but lots of room for improvement"
http://www.golfscript.com/golfscript/quickref.html and all the operators are insanely overloaded, of course
ungodly child of forth and haskell
oh, not implemented in haskell, my bad. ruby
quile: so I am poking around with the broadcaster code. I assume each input should be described in staging.clj?
awesome, thanks
and the :id is what I map?
for channel number
input will be the fifo coming from sox, named based on the hardware card / channel
as in audio channel, not broadcast tv channel
I'll start with a smaller group of channels, just more than 1, and once all those works, upgrade to the full set
easier that way
and how should the :path for each be determined? do they all get the same path?
awesome
cool, thanks
@help stuff
quile: I'll take a stab
I don't see the id mapping on there...
unless it's 1->8 2->9 ...
the mapping is whatever, as long as I know what it should be :)
oh, even easier
BBC1 is on cahnnel 1 in that pdf, right?
down to ITVi stream 44 on channel 20
oh, btw: congrats, eastwood passed the codebase with 0 warnings
yeah
that names a pun btw - lint eastwood
lol
quile: it should be broadcasting channels 1 and 2 right now
the real trick of course will be the card channel / channel-channel mappings, given the three cards and only using at most 10 of the 12 inputs on each...
but that's all in the config file
well, that plus a few changes to the runner script
cool, keep me posted, as they say
ROFL
I'll let you know
so far the stdout is just the initial config map
interesting
awesome
also, do we have a list of which channels out of the 12 are the content we care about?
also I learned an amazing trick for clojure startup time
lein cp > class-path
then, until you change project.clj...
java -cp $(cat class-path)
boom!
like 10x faster startup
quile: OK, updating to broadcast all 12 on one card
next shortly after that will be two cards, all 12 from each
and finally of course all 3
right
if all three cards are posting, we can figure out the right 20, and take out the rest, of course
right
quile: thanks yo
also, I discovered a fast lein option for startup too, after discussing this with technomancy https://www.refheap.com/93231 - check the timings near the bottom
quile: posting too fast? OK
OK, sorry, some lag
hmm - they aren't sending now, checking the logs
crazy lag right now
really crazy amounts of lag all of the sudden
quile: I see no java in the ps
oh - I see, it's the chunk of length 0 thing
OK, yeah, those were what was running last
I need to add a check for 0 length and log it but not send it
it just tight loops on that shit for broken input pipe...
quile: I will have to figure it out - it happens when the input stream is closed
so I guess it is getting 0 length reads?
as soon as I can get the system responsive enough I will shut down that jvm
"ssh root@juked killall java"
hahaaha
quile: right, this is all harder to deal with on a remote machine of course
we need to check for that empty read and abort
or at least shut down that channel and log it
will work on that now
that way even if we lose one channel the others can keep running until a proper reset
also I am thinking of defining all possible channels in the config in clj, and defining the channels to use in one place in the runner (with command line overrides of course)
I hate editing two files in parallel
quile: cool, yeah, that ssh command finally returned
,(char 68)
OK, for now I will test out exiting with code 42 if an input stream ends
if that works, I will work on more granular channel shutdown
quile: the log file for the zero count fingerprints is insane :)
quile: sure thing! but your server should account for that :)
I'll update its time
right, it must be authoritative
done
looks like it was 10 min off? or is my clock skewed too
checking the official now
oh wait, it's an hour off?
can I get confirmation it was an hour and ~8 ?
OK, maybe this website is weird
but it agrees on the minutes
uhh?
OK fixing!
how the fuck
mental math fail
now it should be good
there is a config for linux to use NTP to reset the clock once a day
quile: righto
quile: starting now, I will let you know when you should be seeing incoming
quile: then test shutting off its input, see how it responds
quile: maybe it would be helpful to change the update rate if we have to keep iterating on this?
chunk-size?
will do that if I need to do this again, yeah
OK, some chunks just got pushed, interrupting its input now (and ready to force kill if it goes crazy)
OK, you should get 2 shortened inputs, and that's it
the flooding happens after I shut the input down
it would be happening now
looks like no java even running
awesome!
OK, now jumping up to 12 channels
righto
haven't even changed it yet
the truncated one was just because of the interrupt
so, while this stuff compiles and uploads - this whole thing about caching the classpath and booting up fast without lein and without making an uberjar makes me think of a pretty sweet way to be able to run without lein in production (as it should be) while also being able to hotplug code from the filesystem without downtime
OK 12 channels coming very soon
just sent a batch of all 12
another batch
this is all in dated log files if you want to tail it / double check the output at any point, of course
another batch - stop now or keep running?
are you sure? I set the size too small
I did not use 1440
I used 128
right, the idea was faster turnover on the testing :)
swapping out now
OK, stopped the old
quile: sorry, I keep confusing the log tailing with the process window
haha
killed now
taking a moment to adjust it so it loads staging.clj from the standalone file and not the jar
so that I don't need to recompile the jar to make a config edit
quile: part of checking if the right config file was loaded
answer: no
right, but slurp uses classpath - but let me check if it was pebcak
*pebkac
right, it was pebkac, running as configured now
edited config, ran, checked, still using old config "oh must be loading config the wrong way"
nope
did not push the config to the server
for future reference: I must always check if it is going wrong because I am a dumbass before assuming someone else designed something wrong
quile: so it is running all 12 at the standard rate now, let me know when we have that verified and I will try two cards
great, just give the word
so, shut it down and try the second card along with?
quile: well, it would be easy to go hole hawg and record all input from all 24
not hard to only dump a few of the files
kinda tricky to just do "slices" of time
should I set that up before trying multiple cards?
aha, so I should send you some audio before jumping to multiple cards?
right of course
do you want audio from all channels, one channel, or?
yupo
I may have a false start or two, I will let you know when it is sending for real
floating point exception!
sox gave a random floating point error... this sucks
you may have gotten some very weird packets just now
has anyone ever told you shell scripts are increadibly brittle? because they are fyi
ok broadcasting and dumping right now, let me know when you get enough and I'll make you some nice wavs
hrmph
the java is running and using cpu...
oh shit
haha
restarting soon, stupid typo...
never mind
it just pushed
do you see the pushed data?
OK
let me know when to shut it down
I am going to add a date stamp to the clojure code logging when it pushes chunks btw
we will eventually want that
quile: any reason to make new Thread objects when pushing to the server rather than using the agent pool via future?
right, futures aren't just for results, they also are a thread that gets proper *out* bindings and such and use the pool
hrm...
I wonder what's up with the timing?
it's saying 1440
,(/ (* (/ 1440 32) 8) 60)
bit rate we are asking for is 8k
sure, shutting it all down again
it's cool
I was thrown off before because I was in the middle of a different refactor (for multiple cards) and did a task switch
and stupidly was not on a separate feature branch
my own fault
it's running again
without
could also be something stupid in that multi card refactor...
and there they go
so something happened when I dumped the stream...
weird...
double checking my dumping code
so I can stop this again, right?
https://github.com/juked/kantar-demo/blob/broadcast-multiplex/runner#L32 see anything suspicious?
quile: let me know if this ends up having better timing
should see something ~12 from now
OK
hmm - I wonder if it may have something partially to do with output buffered in the fifos?
oh I bet this is totally part of the issue
quile: so should I shut it down and make the wav files to double check with?
OK, so basically leave it running until I need to try new configs
the twelve files are all there in wav now
~/juked/wav
cool, fifo draining is in and working too
should be getting two cards of data soon
if all is kosher, I can bump that to all three
quile: right, that will be the last stage, as I see it
should have that by end of day easy
ahh and next time I will have to build and deploy the time stamp code too
kind of hilarious how much easier the clojure part is compared to everything else...
not yet
D O G D O G
I see that
I wonder what would make 1-12 be running slower
we may need to look at what is happening in that clojure code...
or maybe 1-12 stopped running?
they did not do the "empty input" announcement where it exits though
quile: what's with this offset thing?
https://github.com/juked/kantar-demo/blob/master/broadcaster/src/broadcaster/core.clj#L19
starts as a random number
OK, was just searching for anything surprising in the code in case it might relate to what's happening :)
OK 12-24 jsut sent again
the fifos are getting data
I used cat, so the data is garbled now, but I am just debugging
I wonder - maybe it has to do with the buffering settings for the fifos?
wait, 5 and 6 should not be up... - unless my logs are messed up
fuckfuckfuck
OK
repeats...
wat
maybe some mislabeling or bad merge is making the wrong channel labels come in?
I will keep studying the clojure code
right
reading and eating lunch right now
quile: cool - just sent a shitload of data and it seemed to straighten out, restarting with better logging
things are looking good this time
quile: so everything looks great for the latest run, and with the time stamps in there it is very clear that it is sending once every 6 minutes within 1 second accuracy
I'm going to switch it over to simultaneously record and analyze, and bump the cards to all 3
putting together a proper "killer" script too
and also, I was thinking so far the first card was index 1
of course the first card is index 0
so from now forward we lose channel contiguity, fyi
I mean this is the break, not no more contiguity
I'd really like to figure out where these transient issues are coming from
but timestamps on the logs for sending will help
the timing changing for no discernable reason
and just now I got a random "unsupported params for card"
that I could not repeat...
these logs look good so far for 3 cards though I think
I just started - had an error right after I said that
should see 3 cards of data very soon, and all three are being dumped, all signs are good
haha, gmt logs can be a head fuck, weird seeing messages from tomorrow
quile: just sent you some prints, but I don't know why some :ids were sent twice and some not at all
this is the issue
somewhere the :id for each broadcaster thread is not cohering...
yeah, looks like nothing past 24 is actually going through
OMFG
I am so sorry
copy/paste fail
my bad entirely
restarting the whole shebang
quile: OK, it looks good from the logs this time
no duplicates
like I said, copy-paste error
I fixed all the numbered fifo names, but forgot the ids
I mean I am not gonna type out 36 almost-identical config maps...
so we are grabbing 36 channels right now, both broadcasting and writing the raw to disk
and I will make the ones on disk into .wav files
and that should be good for verification
also, runner and killer work reliably to start reading all cards and broadcasting, or alternately stop all cards
it's all up there, all sorted out for the night
and now I realize I should have been logging the content of the uploads too...
it's all good though
with the date stamps in the log you can correlate running time and time in the dumped audio I think
cool
yo
it should be running
unless it got stopped
just restarted it
we will have to look at a way to detect it shutting down and restarting it
or ideally make those shutdowns not happen
nope
quile: it's not that simple
there's a process running for the sound card
there's a sox instance for each channel
an maudio instance for each channel
and broadcast
any one of these can fail
the killer script *should* successfully shut all down (except those that are not running of course) so that it can be started up in a consistent state
that script is not known good yet :) but seems to work in random experimentation
the runner itself actually exits immediately, since there is no "primary process" to hold onto
because all the cards are running in parallel
long term, would be best to make it a proper "service"
where you can run a command to see if it is running, run a command to restart / stop etc.
nope
today is a rest day I hope
quile: oh yeah, could implement heartbeat logic in the clojure part, which sends a message if any channel isn't sending data as expected
because I know from experience you can keep a clojure service running for months at a time, no problem
though this would not help if someone decided to kill -9 the clojure process
which is why system service abstractions are usefull - hard to circumvent that by mistake
so if something important comes up today let me know. Otherwise, I have been hyper caffeinated for about a week now and am trying to take a down day.
well awesome
looks like it stopped again :(
should I restart it?
I need to start thinking about how to handle this
it's hard since we are redirecting stdout - though maybe we can catch the stderr...
restarting
quile: if it's alright to wait, I think I'll work on it tomorrow, maybe make the clojure program be in charge of setting up all its input (and restarting as apropriate)
quile: also, fyi, the shutdown / startup is exceedingly simple. killer stops all the assorted background programs, runner starts them all, neither takes arguments (though they must be run from inside /root/juked at this point)
haha
took a long ass nap today
the caffiene abuse was adding up to this frazzled state...
which I could deal with, but it makes me stupider than I realize and I start making silly mistakes
so I need the reset day or two every once in a while
you want it back? I can bring it back
@whatis stuff
@topics
@help stuff
oh that was a gem
@list
OK
@topics
@list
you'd think
quile: so now I have admin access to lazybot, and shell access on the lazybot server
little known fact: the most famous Hedwig of all time is Hedy Lamarr
silliness
it's really funny that I am using an ultra-minimalist wm, but inside a virtualbox running suse I am running kde
quile: cool - I have a goal today of pulling things into the broadcaster
go ahead and kick it when it's down, I'll let you know when I am in there
quile: less likely oom, more likely buffer overrun/underrun on the sound card I think
OK - once things are inside clojure I will have much more flexibility for findint the cause of the issues, and handling them
I wonder what would be accumulating mem...
pretty much everything seems cons-free at a first glance
quile: so I am trying some focus management today, it is going pretty well - setting timers for tasks (even diversions, and sticking to a schedule...)
quile: making progress on managing the processes in clojure, think I got the instrument stuff taken care of at least to the point where I won't have to touch it any until after the juked deadline
oh no, nothing on the server
I will warn you before I do that
just setting up the clojure scaffolding for the processes
quile: basic idea is that when you ask for a specific source to be monitored, it ensures that the "streamer" singleton is running. The streamer runs in a loop. It walks through every card and ensures that a process is reading data from that card (into a byte-array). Then it walks through each monitored channel, and ensures a sox process is running for that channel (starting one if not), and feeding it the next buffer of data from
card input byte-array.
I will also make "shut-down-channel" and "restart-channel" commands, accessible via a protected http-port (which we can decide to forward via some auth scheme or whatever)
where starting a channel starts processing of a card as needed, of course
right
well this is all neccessary for the not-crashing
(well all but the socket part, but that is the easy part)
there's a few layers keeping all the parts of it in sync, with frequent verification that the streams are running
I will need to put in a safecheck that it doesn't go into a tight-loop trying to restart if things go tits-up...
right
the specific goal here is keep everything running
the way I am accomplishing that is an abstraction where each part of the design makes sure its dependencies are running, bottom to top
if I overengineered, worst case I threw away a couple of hours (I have actually been cyclying through teague, lazybot, juked today, round robin, lol)
@last patchwork
@ping
@seen patchwork
quile: now it's likely you who are not around (bout of insomnia here)
hello
got the email, if that works, it works
but I had a brainstorm this morning, and whether the thing I make is useful for *this* or not, I think it would be cool to make
right
so I'll work on a more reliable solution, may not end up needing it, but nice if it works
right...
OK, so I will keep at it
right
quile: so I got my lazybot and instrument stuff all sorted out yesterday, plan being that I could focus now, which I am doing
cool, I assume I'll be updated then
quile: you around?
quile: hey, how about now?
quile: HAHA
I am sure you are not around
hey
I am on GMT now, until the demo is done :)
I have the clojure controlled thing SO CLOSE to working
but also, I updated the version with the shell script and I think it will be much less likely to shut down
let's see
(it's been running for a while now)
quile: also, because I keep PID files for each subprocess, I think we can modify the cron job so that it only restarts if any of those PIDs are dead
quile: around?
hello
quile: still here?
card 0 is fucked
it's not giving me data
I reverted to the old version of the script, turned the crontab back on
I have no fucking idea
not that I know of...
but if they are, that would explain why I can't use the card
I sent ravosh a pm about it
yes, let's
I lost a lot of time thinking something was fucked up with my setup (I have a newer version that lets each card be restarted individually)
could be..
what the fuck
sure, am I OK to reboot it?
rebooting now, hopefully this helps
fucking again....
OK I have no idea why this is happening
I don't think it's locked - I don't know what's happening
the broadcasters for channels 1-12, which are all on card 0, are not sending data
all the others (the other two cards) are
let me double check that
I undid that change
everything is at the state it was before, except one thing where broadcaster was overly eager to exit
but I can roll that back too if it comes to that
it's about midnight gmt now
I checkout out and cleaned, and deployed the code that was working before
no luck
yes
everything was shut off completely
yes, arecord spews audio
not quite, but yeah, I'll reconstruct the shell pipeline
first sox
right
arecord -Dhw:0,0 -q -fdat -c12 --format=S32_LE -r8000 | sox -q -r 8000 -t s4 -c 12 - -t s2 -c 1 - remix 1 | ./maudio - 4000 1 1 > dump
that works
the only difference in the script is the various pipelining, but that is identical regardless of the card
I just sent the full debug output in an email
shows the +x log of all commands in the script
everything looks right
I did every step in between
I did arecord, arecord+sox, arecord+sox+maudio
also the broadcaster is rebuilt, it's the version that was working a couple of days back
another bit of info: the arecord process for that card is running
right
but htop shows that it has not had any CPU time scheduled
unlike the other arecord processes, it is not using CPU cycles, at all
as if it is blocked...
yes
renamed the fifos to match the system card numbers
the staging.clj file reflects this status
right
where do you get the 8 hours ago figure?
card-x-y-fifo is only used by the runner version that has processes all controleld by clojure
which is not running
right, commented it out
OK
oh shit!
it may have been blocking on feeding that fifo
because nothing was reading it
so the buffer would fill?
shit shit shit
right!
I feel pretty stupid right now
so, if that works, I will switch back to the version with separate runners for each card, that is less likely to bail...
yeah
man, thanks a ton
(in advance, I am sure this will fix it...)
the funny thing is, I was even thinking about the backpressure issue: we may need to tee off the data to the local filesystem fingerprinter as well
and I was like (to my self) "oh shit, that can't just be uncoordinated, or the backpressure will fuck it all up)
yeah
now, that should be straightforward
yeah, so I heard
right
if this works, I am going to sleep - I have been up since about 3 am
haha
trying to be on GMT
since I have no family or life to prevent it
I should see packets send any minute here
turns out doing a task every 61 minutes is hard!
OK THAT FIXED THAT ISSUE
yessir
OK
do remember that there is a log showing when things got sent, and PID files with each part of the thing - so some perl may be able to work some magic
right
cool, you have my number if something is urgent
quile: nope, everything goes to the log file
np
I'll share my number around
OK, that was a damn good rest
quile: update: running the split (and more resiliant) version of things - each card is a separate restartable process tree, and the clojure code sleeps if it gets empty input (instead of shutting down) and also I turned the line-seq into (apply concat (repeatedly #(line-seq ...))) such that if it gets EOF on a fifo (because the process died) it just reopens it and continues reading lines
it's working
so my work yesterday wasn't totally thrown away, sweet
stepping away for coffee, this is my "morning"
it's broadcasting, and the restarter is shut down, lets see if it will stay up a few hours, I think it will
I think I can make a simple input-line rekicker that leaves broadcaster running too
may even integrate all that into the clj
cool
brb
of course
keeping everything very modular at this point
and making sure a full rollback is trivial if there is a hiccup in this
from my experimentation the killer / runner will work the same way with this version, even if it needs periodic kicking though
and only doing full-world deploys now
the thing that tripped me up last time was I was deploying individual files as I updated them, so the time the problem started happening and the time I made the mistake did not match :P
because I updated a file, forgot to deploy it, it got deployed the next day and I forgot it was a recent change...
who would think that arbitrary, non-repeatable, piecemeal mutation would lead to errors?
so, it's been good for over an hour now (if it looks right on that end at least)
kickass
yeah, I will be up watching it for sure
quile: setting a six minute repeating timer, so I can quickly see if things start going wrong
I wonder if there is an expect script for tailing log files
I had an idea once for doing expect in clojure
quile: just hit the two hour mark, all channels printing and sending
I expect to just keep watching it do it's thing at this point
looks like things are in pretty decent shape
yup
4,5
I had a brainstorm waking up: clojure is capable of doing everything arecord and sox are. If I have a chance to do a clean redesign (ie. not on a tight deadline like right now) I could make it so all that's needed is one instance of broadcaster which opens all three sound cards using java audio api, and then starts and feeds / reads from N instances of maudio
I've messed with that byte-level stuff from the sound card in clojure, so it's not like it's terra incognita for me
interesting
right
still going...
3 hours!!! WOO
So yeah, this is looking much better. I will throw together a small "restart-card" that allows specifying a specific card to restart. Now that the clojure code is using apply concat on line seq, it will repeatedly re-open the fifo even after getting an eof
apply concat repeatedly line-seq that is
that's what was happening with those repeated 0 size broadcasts
the root case was reading an eof from the fifo
the eof being left over from a previous run, where the output had not been fully consumed
I added dd to the runner script to drain the fifos, but the root problem of not handling the eof on the fifo proerly was still there
it's still going!
if I see an anomaly, I will restart the apropriate card, otherwise, just watching
the cards are actually individually restartable now
but we shouldn't even need that
hello?
quile: back, it was nap time
fingerprint broadcaster is SUPER STABLE now
in less happy news, I killed box 2 accidentally and it had to be reinstalled :(
but it looks to be up again
stupid package install shenanigans
lesson learned - not only will zypper stab you in the back if you let it (as I learned before) but it will actively sneak up and stab you
last time, there was a warning I unwisely ignored
this time, it was acting like all was well and normal...
and then boom, ssh is broken
THE ONE THING THAT HAD TO NOT BREAK
D O G!!!!
definitely left me feeling the jackass, paymann trying to figure out how to fix it with my lack of expertise guiding him second hand...
poor guy
but hey, broadcaster is super fucking stable now :)
it has the OS reinstalled
I will be logging in shortly
then I will refine my modified runner script
as of right now it has been upfor about 8 hours
(the broadcaster that is)
I am logged in
I will need to download individual rpms to install our deps... :(
but I don't trust the package manager now (for obvs. reasons I hope) so that is the only way to do it
right, I think I got it, yeah for box 2
luckily sox has a very small dep tree
but I feel like a caveman installing via rpm, lol
at least it's not GUI installers with click-through licenses
WANGERNUMB
LET'S ROTATE THE BOARD, DOGDOG
quile: other version of maudio is up and running, looking great so far
slight hiccup with a misleading error message, but all looks good after reading the source and figuring out what the command should actually be
though I see "C:/users/ravosh/Desktop/" used in constructing the filename... that looks bad
quile: haha, yeah, we sorted it out
typical demo-stage codebase
gives me a chance to show of the small amount of C++ I know, heh
quile: so my system clock is on GMT while I work on this, so at first I was like "well of course you will be in and out, it's 10:30 pm!"
oh yeah, definitely
I will see if I can set up ntp on this suse version
goddamit all the official docs are GUI shit
I am not going to try to run remote X from england
I mean it would be fun, but...
kde, with all gfx turned on
and the packets can't decide whether to cross the atlantic or pacific...
well, sure they's pick atlantic of course, but a bit if hyperbole doesn't hurt
D O G D O G D O G D O G
quile: so, I added a proper ntp server, I think it may take a moment or two to get a new update
but if we keep seeing a bad offset, we can def fix
right
I did a manual reset for now, and am taling the ntp log for activity
I think the machine just has some drift (typical)
that's what ntp does, in theory at least
so nice, htop running on split screens on each host, watching the maudio processes plug away
I'll be catching zzzs soon
trying to stay on their schedule
things look pretty good, though I did just have to restart maudio2
maudio1 / broadcaster have been rock solid
quile: yeah, I was just talking with ravosh
yeah
cool, that seems easier at this point
0 fingerprints should be very easy to detect
and as I told ravosh, I trust the sox analyzer that told me which channels were silent
quile: right, but that thing about the fingerprints makes it easy to see which are silent
aha!
I will redo at noon
channel 12 is a digital in
OK
and the indexes aren't getting mangled somewhere?
Ok
also, I did that recording at like 11 am
so the not broadcasting thing does not come into play
and exactly 20 channels gave me non-zero audio
that's too accurate for a coincidence...
but anyway, post-hoc
you can treat my input as a black box
and I will do my best to make sure broadcaster is at least sending all data unambiguiously :)
the fifo numbers are being derived from the same arguments that tell arecord / sox what to read, so if the fifo names are good in the config, the data from those fifos will be
also, I really love the search feature in htop :) makes me very happy
F3 -> maudio -> boom, all maudio instances are at the top of the list
DOG
absolutely not
quile: sox would crash if I asked for channel 12 and the channels were indexed from 0
you can see from the process output that no sox instance is doing "remix 0"
no, no wrapping
there is no such thing
audio data comes in frames, n samples of each channel
in our case, the common case of 1 sample each channel per frame
sox takes each frame, and makes index 0 channel 1, index 1 channel 2, etc.
that's just not how it's done
right, I am pretty sure sure there is an off by one somewhere
it is easy to verify that there is no fifo for a channel 0, and that no running sox is doing "remix 0" (which would select a channel 0)
D O G D O G D O G
ahh, OK
I like triple-checked :)
quile: arecord does nothing with channels
other than deciding how many exist
it gives you a) all channels or b) no data
no other choices
you can try it, it will crash if you ask for a channel count other than 12
right
also, there is no metadata in the audio stream
the format is very simple
so arecord is handing raw bytes to sox, and sox partitions them, saying "first 32 bits are channel one, next 32 bits are channel 2 ..."
there are no headers or sanity checks, just bytes
but it still tends to work :)
part of this being because the callbacks refuse to handle anything but frame-boundary amounts of data
cool, not trying to be argumentative, but just to establish that I really did consider all these things
not possilbe
because sox crashes if you ask for channel 0
sox recognizes no such possibility
one possibility...
if we lost 32 bits at the beginning of the pipe, all the input could be off by one
but why would we lose 32 bits at the beginning of the pipe?
otherwise the data would be all garbage
the samples are 32 bits each
the buffering will be a multiple of 32 bits, and things are working on buffers
quile: if that is happening, we can just treat it as a black box, as I suggested before... as long as the offset is reliable / repeatable
and it really does seem to be
cool
this is something that pulling everything into clojure would help with I think
no more pipes, having very explicit control of the data buffers
cool beans,  Iagree
also it will reduce the server load quite a bit
much smaller process count, fewer context switches
patchwork: long time no see!
pretty good, I've been working on that fingerprinting project with quile
had to keep GMT working hours the last few days
which is rough at this age
anyway, getting paid to set up a 36 channel audio processing system on a server in another continent
only hosed the server once :P
they wanted to process channels individually, which led to this crazy setup with ~300 system fifos...
patchwork: it led to a design for future usage
patchwork: think max/msp for things that consome and emit bytes
patchwork: well, linux audio can be a big pain in the ass, but my past frustration is finally paying off in hard cash
patchwork: so far I have a protocol, defined for java.lang.Process (feed it bytes, get bytes out) and a couple of Record types (one that contains a function taking / returning bytes, the other containing a function taking / returning lines of text)
OK
patchwork: this is silly https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mxzgwJ8tSE0
no, that it made me want that
because a shell pipeline with 37 programs in it is fragile as fuck
err 38
if just 1 of those programs stops reading, everything above it gets stalled by backpressure
and you can't just swap out one part ofthe pipeline...
reliability nightmare
you basically divide your average runtime by 38
at first, all three cards were in one shell, which meant dividing runtime by 114
1 broadcaster (clojure, don't want multi instances), one audio dumper for each of three cards
then 12 pipelines teed off each card to capture the separte channels
because you can't just tell the OS "open channel 3 of the card" - there is no such operation
parallel, fully parallel
the device just does not provide any option for separate data, so you need to separate out the channels, and make a pipeline for each
and all have to come from the same input source
no backpressure issues
fully able to modular restart
right
thus my idea to create a data graph
where each node describes how to launch a process
so, you walk the graph
if the node is dead, clean it up and relaunch
if it is alive, feed it the byte array from the previous step
you could even define mergers - for example a line interleave that feeds data as lines of text and merges them, or an adder, that basically just sums byte values
whatever makes sense for this sort of data stream
(the summing is more likely to be on chunks - like in this case if were were merging, we would treat them as 32 bit signed values, chunks of 4 bytes)
so anyway, that would be an awesome little tool
and you could intermix pure clojure code with processes
right!
byte-flow
there are tricky things to consider though
like things that merge have to deal with the possibility that things could try to feed it at different speeds
so an additive merge should be an init error in such a case...
but for interleaving lines, just throw them all in there (think a dedicated logger, just outputting every line it gets with a time stamp to a file)
right
this turns "backpressure" to a first class thing, that you can deal with in clojure code
by filling in with 0s, or buffering, or whatever
whatever makes sense for that data
anyway, I think this is totally doable
and it could have an awesome max/msp style UI
lol
haha
or hell, it could be a swing / html canvas
patchwork: it could probably be done with core.async, putting byte-arrays onto channels
explicitly building a graph and recursively launching threads from a pool to cycle on each linear chain in parallel would likely perform better
but likely harder to set up too
ie if you have a->b a->c->d b+d->e you would have one thread cycling on a, one on b, one on c->d, and one on b+d->e
so it would pay off to do explicit threads if you had longer linear chains
patchwork: fully general if you have the right parsing tool
knowing where the threads should be is knowable from the graph structure
right
it would be a compilation step
I'm thinking: input is either a literal tree rep, or an adjacency list
then you have a compiler that figures out the threads to launch, and constructs the runnables, and sets up the queues for passing the byte-arrays
or likely an object, with a time-index and a byte-array
each data source would write a new byte array, and throw it into the line
as an optimization, there could be reusable byte-arrays, but then we are doing our own resource management - which can pay off in a case like this where usage rules are super simple, but also isn't trivial
so hold off until we need it to be that fast :)
a simple version of this that scales to all the nifty stuff should be doable when I recover from my recent hammering on that audio stuff
hmm... I could consider that. I am a little burnt out from the GMT conversion...
but actually yeah, let's do that
I have been too isolated
patchwork: in transition
I was keeping england hours until today
now re-adjusting
had to collaborate pretty tightly, which meant being up when they were
patchwork: pretty much, yeah
or a bit before that really
they are 7 hours ahead, so more like 1 or 2
haha
I slept a lot today
I reset the time on my computer to GMT - which helped maintain the right hours, but was also a headfuck
so, around 6 or so, maybe we could get food at the tabor tavern and then do some coding?
6051
also you can just text when you get here
cool
patchwork: awesome
that's exactly the sort of thing I am working with here
yo
good. used sql to do multi-model caribou search
I'm more and more a fan of just using sql
got a report that polaris sanitize-action rejects multimethods, so figuring out the best extensible way to deal with that
*sanitize-action-subspec that is
patchwork: sql also saves a lot of time/ work
(for the machine, at runtime)
patchwork: right, but unlike caribou's model abstraction, it was primarily designed for querying, while caribou is better at persistence / generality of data, but worse at querying
 (= (type print-method) clojure.lang.MultiFn)
where print-method is an example of a multimethod
patchwork: that ztellman talk I emailed you about seems apropos here
(it has inspired me to try out prismatic/graph)
also, I have switched to evil-mode because emacs keybindings were killing me
like literally reducing the hitpoints of my fingers and wrists whenever I used them
it's not a coincidence that the most avid emacs users tend to have carpal tunnel issues. Though a better desk would help, keybindings that are not chorded help a lot.
every place where I need it I can use emacs bindings still
but I get a layer of one-letter vi style bindings as the primary one
which is nice as someone who used vi for a year or two
sure - and I use emacs chords when I need them
but the basics - grab text, delete, switch buffers, etc. no chords
I make extensive usage of "evil-leader-mode", which turns a keypress into a prefix, where every key on the keyboard is a different command
like C-x or C-c or whatever, but no chording
(I use ,  - easy to use, and the vi command is not one I use)
not ctrl, just ,
in totally other news, I saw Birdman, best movie I have seen in a while
hollywood has been getting more and more formulaic, and birdman is actually about an actor escaping hollywood for the theater - very pomo
interstellar is in many ways one of those formulaic movies though
it also addresses the phenomenon of comic book movies
the main character is haunted by the success of "birdman"
coincidentially, the actor, Michael Keaton, is known among other things for playing "batman"
it's good, especially good if you have hung out with theater people at any point, they really capture that slice of society
and what's rare in movies any more, they capture what's unique about these people, not vague generalities and platitudes that everybody/nobody can relate to
I hate that about hollywood
I listen to them frequently - some of the mid-later ones get corny, but overall high quality
the Emerson complete set, and the Berg complete set
the latter is cheap on Amazon (if you are one to pay for music)
but it isn't broken down to tracks, only to disks sadly
but it's a decent performance
cool
more like proofs, or like axioms?
I actually got a chance to read some stuff on fourier analysis recently. Most of it is still beyond me but I start to understand more and more of it.
I still find it fascinating that the pure case only allows for infinite signals (temporally isolated signals require an infinite spectra)
so either your frequency list or your duration of signal are infinite
or you cheat and use the windowed version like an engineer :)
you could as well say theory is great, provided you have access to infinities
it gets way messy without them ...
speaking of! agpl only requires publicising the code of your server. If the server only has neo4j on it, that is all you need to publish.
the point of agpl is if you provide access to the thing to the public, the public should see the source
but it doesn't mean they need to see the source of your other code that uses that service
patchwork: I asked with some buddies in open source who I consider pretty knowledgable
and the neo4j folks have every incentive to spread confusion about this of course
true, but the agpl itself is not a super complex document. I guess one would need a lawyer to know whether it is simple in a good way or in a bad way :)
on another topic entirely, they discovered a malware that a) infects sites running php b) infects windows users visiting those sites c) infects other machines on their lan d) if that machine is part of telco infrastructure, infects gsm cell tower base-stations e) infects sim-cards on cell phones
fucking insane!
tracks your cell phone usage, who you call, who calls you, etc.
clearly this is coming from a state agency, and they like to know who communicates with who
well, who else is that organized, but we don't have proof it was a state agency
patchwork: the NSA has a huge budget for hiring very smart engineers
yeah
right, and that's a great chain of weakest links: php, IE, windows lan, gsm push updates to sim cards
all of those are notorious (though this is the first documented case of the last one being exploited)
did you know every sim card runs a very small version of java?
(it's the wordnick wotd, synonym for dell)
quile: yo!
fixed the instability issues and the channel offset, both had the same issue
quile: somewhat, last I heard things were sounding good
quile: so get this: I was mistakenly asking arecord for wav data. Wav data has a fucking header. Thus our offset channel rotate off by one.
quile: point number 2: wav data holds a number in the header, 32 bits, of how many bytes are in the output
quile: so when it got to the max amount of data that would fit in that field, it would close the file
boom
that's the instability right there
quile: right, but were derived from sox - we told sox "this is a raw audio stream, get channel 1"
quile: in fact it was not a raw audio stream - it was an audio stream preceded by a header
quile: I did not change the broadcaster
only the on-disk fingerprinter
for that very reason
so the broadcaster gets restart glitches, the on-disk fingerprinter gets long process life, and accurate channels
quile: yeah, I explicitly asked about this before restarting, and did not restart for that reason
for sure
the process has been going for four days and starting for box 2, with no restarts
which, compared to previously, is fucking amazing :)
next time I do anything like this it will be so much easier
I am proud of things staying up now, but also ashamed at the long list of mistakes preceding that
but such is learning
quile: in other news, I got tired of emacs keybindings and am in permanent vim emulation mode now
I like emacs for the features, hate the keybindings, yeah
they are inhumane
weapons of torture
so now I have best of both worlds - emacs features / emacs embedded apps like org mode and erc, plus vim bindings
evil does have some places where the abstractions leak, but I know enough emacs to handle it when that happens. For a new user it is probably not nearly as nice though :(
also, leader-mode is great for replacing all my C-x prefix / C-c prefix commands
*evil-leader-mode
I turned comma into a prefix key
patchwork: yes
http://vim.wikia.com/wiki/Best_Vim_Tips patchwork if you turn on evil mode, all the stuff on the first quarter of this page works. Though be prepared for silliness in the first stages.
yeah, vim commands have a grammar
which composes
so unlike emacs
patchwork: also, with evil mode, you always have M-x as an escape hatch, no matter the weird state things get into
quile: I love it so far, though as I think I mentioned, it would likely be an odd way to learn emacs
patchwork: yeah, and it generalizes to most actions and all movements
which is like the emacs commands that replace in region, or when you narrow to region, but due to multiple marks it's more general
though you can do something similar with emacs registers holding marks, it's clumsier in emacs
composibility is everything, as ztellman says
the : prompt is like an extended ed
patchwork: , creates a range
so it takes a mark on each side of it
yeah, registers were implemented badly in emacs, usability wise
much more accessible in vi
https://twitter.com/codinghorror/status/537010861919830016
paredit doesn't work nicely with evil in emacs, though it sounds like you are just straight up using vim patchwork ?
makes sense
also, remember that : gives you a superset of ed that is mostly compatible
for those rare moments it would be easier to do something the ed way...

patchwork: so it's actually surprising how much birdman and interstellar have in common
yeah
without spoiling I hope: both are about old men who struggle to gain the approval of the women in their lives who are disappointed in them, and prove to the world that they can "do the thing" that they in their hearts always knew they were meant to do
along the way the have strange phantasmogorical experiences, fly, have powers that seem supernatural, cry, and prove that love really matters
also, they spend much of their time talking 1 to 1 with what is essentially a human made construct
oh, and the primary disappointed woman each wants to impress is their own angry/estranged daughtors
and each has spent their time in a career they are not proud of (thus needing the above proving to the world they can do the thing they were meant to do)
ha
 oh, also, both men do things that all logic and sense tells us will kill you, and they seem to survive it just fine. Over and over.
in both cases having to do with the force of Gravity!
tell that to these movies, and my ignorant incomplete education
so what is it?
and what does saying it is not a force mean in context of Russel proving that physics makes sense without a variable for force?

did you guys hear about Regin?
it infects php sites
then, from in the php server, it infects windows browsers
from the windows machines, it infects windows lans
from there it looks for hardware controlling cell phone infrastructure
from there it infects sim cards
well, surprise surprise, it hasn't yet targeted anyone in the US :)
which ones?
cfleming is a nice guy on IRC too

(as I was just reminded)
hello!
I decided to make a clojure lib for nethack-lisp (the UI layer for nethack that sends all game data as sexprs, designed for emacs0
I can parse all the data using read
but I found a hilarious problem
if I want to select option "b" from a menu, I have to send the command "gosouthwest"
because the canonical binding for the b key in nethack is southwest (a diagonal derived from hjkl navigation)
topsy-turvy
to select option "c" I need to send "close"
(as in close door)
it's like a keybinding mnemonic system, but inside out
I already know all the commands, it would be infinitely easier to just send "b" and let the game interpret it...
(whether walking or interacting with a menu)
patchwork: needing to say "gosouthwest" when the menu says "b" is super weird
this is not in a movement context
it does a global translation of gosouthwest to b
so menus require nonsense commands
so: api says "a for archeologist, b for barbarian ..." I send "b" or \b and it crashes
I send
gosouthwest, and it selects barbarian
wrong layer for the abstraction :)
so I succeeded in doing the reverse mapping based on the command definitions and the key bindings https://github.com/noisesmith/nethacker/blob/master/src/org/noisesmith/nethacker/keys_wat.clj
I am simultaniously proud and ashamed to have read elisp using the clojure reader

we should meet up for lunch again sometime soon, guys
I did a hermit thanksgiving, so I haven't seen much of other folks lately
patchwork: get this - the last time you came over is the last time I hung out with someone.
patchwor`: you know about "/msg nickserv ghost packtwork <password>" right?
how the fuck did I get packtwork from patchwork anyway???
patchwor`: how about lunch tomorrow? I can come out to that neighborhood - where's that pho place at?
patchwor`: cool, meet you there
patchwor`: so I updated polaris to use a multimethod for handler resolution instead of the cond form, because a user wanted to provide a multimethod as a handler which didn't work because ##(fn? print-method) multimethods aren't fn
ugh, I don't know how to deploy to clojars any more now that ssh is turned off
patchwor`: never mind, the only problem was that I am not a member of polaris
changing the project.clj temporarily to put it in the noisesmith group let me deploy
can I get added to polaris so I can deploy there?
nope, scp is not allowed any more
and anyway, the real problem is I am not a member of the group I was trying to deploy to :)
the https method works fine when making noisesmith/polaris though
awesome, thanks!

so, I just discovered some old work - projects half finished from years ago

hah, mixed bag (which I would say of more recent things as well)
I forgot how much ocaml code I wrote

now I am trying to recover my knowledge of how one gets data to / from the tandy 102 via serial port

hello patchwork
patchwork: yeah, I think I could do Sunday, when/where?
patchwork: cool
today I am trying to port some windows c++ code to run on suse linux
yesterday I was trying out foundationdb
because a potential client uses that
a highly reliable key value store
think mongodb but faster and more stable and costs money
http://blog.foundationdb.com/call-me-maybe-foundationdb-vs-jepsen
http://aphyr.com/posts/283-call-me-maybe-redis
according to jepsen, yes, much more reliable than redis at a first glance
tl;dr foundationdb invokes network splits and outages and machine unavailability as part of their development process
so unsurprisingly it works under those conditions
whereas the redis guys are like "yeah it loses data when you do that, what's the big deal?"
jepsen is a real game-changer in the db world, aphyr is doing god's work
patchwork: have you looked at pixie? it's a clojure-like with immutable datastructures by default and clojure friendly syntax built using pypy
fast bootup, very low resource usage
fair point, but the surface I interact with is a clojure with a very small footprint
which makes me happy
as in - starts instantly, very low memory usage
fills a niche I would have liked to use clojure in for some things, but never really could
I just plugged one of the pins of the serial output of my Tandy 102 into an amp. I think I am going to make noise via tandy BASIC
so I did some basic programming today
resetting the speed on the serial line, outputting some bytes, get a new speed from the keyboard, repeat
yes I used gosub
lol
gosub right off the bat, eh
I am also using datomic right now, for the first time ever
it's interesting
quile: this is actually a job for jono
putting some data from the oregon secretary of state into a datomic db, followed by an api based on datomic queries about that data
I'm learning a lot. APIs.
patchwork: we'll see how far it goes, but at least some contract work for now
yet another API to learn soon, teague is moving to a new job opening API provider...
I did
it was a nice talk

finally got my first ever datomic POC working
like many other things in clojure world, it can be maddening in it's readiness to accept garbage input without complaint, and you finally see your problem many steps further down the line
I want to use prismatic/schema to make a validator for datomic inputs, so others can be spared my pain

it turns out Tandy 102 portable computers are pretty damn cheap online. that plus how fucking durable they are (I have one from the '80s, it works great) is intreguing
D O G D O G D O G D O G
so I think I did a silly thing
I got two more tandy 102s, they were cheap
I may put my beable bone inside one, if I ever get the motivation to figure out how to connect it to the keyboard / display
that would be an awesome little super-portable super-long-battery-life tool
but hey, the one I have now is 30 years old and still has no flaws
D O G D O G D O G
we could blame mongoDb
patchwork: absolutely. I have a basic program that reads a key, sets the serial port speed based on that key, and spews out specially formed data strings to the serial port.
so I have a certain amount of control of pitch, timbre, timign
*timing
it's a bit clumsy still, but def usable for a noise show :)

so here's a cool thing: I got a recorder that will do overdubbing, and I was wishing it did proper multitracking
and then I realized, linear algebra to the rescue!
it keeps each pre-overdubbed version, alongside the new overdubbed
so if I take each, and subtract the most immediate prior version from it, I get the isolated tracks
(unless something goes nonlinear, of course - then linear algebra is no help)
indeed
anyway, that was a fun little trick to discover. It's rare to be able to exploit linear algebra outside code, so it felt good :)
and of course the subtraction step can be done by simply inverting the phase of one track in my daw
like magic

quile: ever hear of that piece by Alvin Lucier "I am sitting in a room" ?
yeah - not just copied but played back into the room
I had an idea to do a modern version where instead of repeatedly playing back and recording in the same room, I would send a live audio feed to multiple servers over UDP, and play the data as it is sent back - the variable drops and bad ordering and shifting latencies should create a reverb effect if I put a gaussian envelope on the audio in the data packets coming back
quile: right
especially if I use a distribution of varied packet sizes (so no strong coloration derived from the size of the broken up packets)
I am thinking about the networked world as I work using bluetooth keyboard and ssh on my phone, sitting in the cafe at ikea drinking coffee
it has a cafe

random weird place to go
I want to do a research of random places I can set up and work remote
community centers? libraries? the zoo? mall food courts?
the airport, of course
also, a very liberating aspect of this is that a) I got an external USB charging battery pack (can keep a smart phone running for a week of normal usage, or a couple of days of constant usage), and when I do everything via ssh, the load on the phone's processor is very low

quile: so I went to what I thought was going to be an art opening at glyph cafe downtown yesterday

so get this, on Saturday I went out to do some field recording in Forest Park, and I got off the bus a stop or two too early
and while walking along the road to get to the trailhead, I found a roadside shrine to someone named "Mic"

I have no idea! something like that
it definitely made walking down that road (in dusky light) quite a bit scarier

the translation would be a simple screen scrape, taking the text, ignoring everything else (and leaving the href properties at least)

yeah - I think Pythagoris Switch is better though
great for zoning out to
and the fact that one of them will be this elaborate precisely engineered thing which was clearly the result of weeks of work, and another will just be a pill flipping over a few times then dropping down a chute has to be like the most Japanese thing ever
rewatching OK Go now...
I'm so sad they are out of tickets to Bartok / Beethoven / whoeverelse tonight

you didn't bring that book to work today did you?
cutest hard drive ever https://i.imgur.com/AwnJetK.jpg
patchwork: sure, but the reading thing is tonight :(
I would have made specific plans Friday if I remembered MLK day
it's not a huge deal, I can bring whatever
it's just a small party at a friend's house, I would have invited but it didn't seem like an "invite whoever" thing...
oh, yeah
let's
anywhere is fine for me
patchwork: sounds good
patchwork: it's in my calendar
patchwork: hey, I was out and about. I will definitely consider that.
I did some recording of viola in the field. https://soundcloud.com/information/a-bow-line-and-follow-it
best of luck
patchwork: you will be invited to the next reading out loud party. It's a sort of subdued party (hosted by teetotaler vegans) but there was some good stuff read
someone brought "english as she is spoke" and read part of it. A classic.
patchwork: everyone who has any desire to
I read from Jesse Ball, Italo Calvino, and Samuel Beckett
Alma also had a few things to read, Emily had a couple
I ended up reading pretty much all his books
but that night I brought "Linus and Vera"
because it is made of fun and very short episodic stand-alone stories
it's a collaboration with his wife, Thordis Bjornsdottir
I can bring it today and we can trade off if you like
yeah, 12:45 would be great
blip blip blip
I was. I just got a recording of that park

the real estate guy was the one being guarded by the neo-nazis, and was being reprogrammed by the mormon cult

patchwork: did I mention that Henry Kaiser concert?
Henry Kaiser is a weirdo guitarist. Top hit if you google him is the youtube video "henry kaiser - worlds worst guitarist"
he also did all the music for "Encounters at the End of the World" - Herzog's Antarctica movie
and all the underwater photography
he's the one who plays the guitar on top of an igloo in the movie, if you saw it
anyway, he played yesterday night - guitar accompanyment to high res video of him cavorting with seals and starfish under the antarctic ice
plus he played some blues rock (really weird blues rock, in the way he does)
worst guitarist ever, henry kaiser https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2PpAG8gTURw
that's pretty much how he solos
"you put schoenburg in my malmsteen!"
and of course the typical response is in the youtube comments "doesn't even know what key he is playing in"

so far I can find nothing on the web that defines "agent" the way clojure does
I was hoping there were papers or something
oh.. yeah I keep forgetting if agents are part of STM
for example I know atoms are not STM...
I'm starting to wonder - all the hits for "agent STM" are clojure, or the scala copying of the idea from clojure
the wikipedia page for software transactional memory is quite thorough, and does not mention agents
it looks like stm comes from the haskell folks, and they don't mention agents
I mentioned it there, may need to go deeper into that question
perhaps a post on the ml
D O G D O G
patchwork: I missed early bird. I might get tickets out of pocket, not sure.
quile: I figured out how to do a basic libc popen + fork in pixie
next is to get proper two way communication on a pair of pipes, and then exec, and I can do shell scripting in pixie
it's got most of the things I love about clojure, but much better startup time
and much lower mem usage
the idea is a tool that would be better suited for what I was trying to do for that juked project
quile: that's exactly what I am doing yeah
and I am using fork / popen / etc. as interop with libc
I may need to extend their ffi namespace in the compiler a bit to get the functionality I need (pointer arithmatic to get the second fd from popen)
but I have enough baseline C and clojure to make all that work - I just need to fill in the missing python piece (it uses rpython to compile its vm)
then I can interop on select / poll and make yet another web server, haha
justin holguin had a hilarious story at clojerks last night - a big node.js conf and they only had one food truck, and everyone just got in one long line
like - shouldn't they have all just dropped off their order and their phone number?
 /rimshot
yeah, good talk
I got some pixie shit figured out!
I used ffi to open a pipe, and fork (successfully printing from both processes after the fork)
patchwork: fnhouse
next step is to use each end of the pipe to communicate between the forked processes
yeah!
also, startup for the full vm with compiler is super fast, and the RAM usage is equivalent to 10 bash shells
which is actually really small
yeah - it has some rough edges
the version that can work without a GIL per process is linux-only, and all the devs use OSX
so I may make my own linux-specific thread-supporting linux-only fork
or just use fork + pipes and do it that way
also, exec looks like it will be straightforward, then I have a proper shell without needing to use the system shell
patchwork: it could be similar to scsh - which is cool but a bit outdated
but better because it is like clojure
quile: I should have mentioned, jed and I were talking about getting 3 people without employers buying out tickets together for a group discount
it's only 10% though
patchwork: not one who is paying for his ticket
I should have put it that way
I hate how long it takes to rebuild pixie when I make a change, but it's cool that it prints an ascii art fractal every time
hmm - not sure if it is different
there is lots of screen scroll and the fractal gets interrupted by compiler messages

quile: yes the file is in the war
quile: but wrap-resource refuses to serve it in prod (under tomcat)
I'm reluctant to change my entire server config including my application container just so a file named aksldfjalksdjflkas. instead of klajdsflkadsjf.gif can be served
right
tomcat already explodes the war every time, I guess i could make the app look in the magic directory with wrap-file...
?
I'm using wrap-resource currently
I need one or the other
unless you suggest I create a new endpoint just for this bullshit file
I don't see what my options are for serving this other than wrap-file / wrap-resource
it's a static html directory created by the client
currently it is a subdirectory inside the war, that tomcat also extracts with the rest of the war
via wrap-resource, the asset is looked up successfully from inside the war file
unless it ends with a .
then ring refuses to serve the file
it's an animated gif
not at all!
but I think the problem may extend to other files that lack an extension from which one could guess a file type?
I could test that I guess
yeah, I am thinking it is either a problem with ring, or the caribou middlewares
I am asking on #clojure about ring, here about caribou :)
I am a bit suspicious about this "wrap-default-content-type" middleware in caribou.app.middleware
hmm
quile: so I tracked it down!
anybot: shh
quile: anyway, I tried a gazillion things - I ruled out varnish, nginx, ring, caribou
turns out it's a bug in tomcat
so I let the wrap-resource fall over to a wrap-file
giving the location of tomcat's unpacked files
yeah, you were pointing me that way
and it was totally correct
so I've lost yet more respect for tomcat
and anybot???
oh man this room gets crazy with the two of them
,(rand-int Double/NaN)
,(rand-int Double/NaN)
patchwork: yeah, it was fucking tomcat
well, there are two idiots here - tomcat refusing to serve files with weird names, and the client for not giving me files with sensible names :)
I deployed way too many minimally breaking apps before narrowing it down, I tell you what
it treated a file with a name like asdf. as if it wasn't even served
it became a 404
really messed up
like dude, my app knows the file it wants to serve...
maybe

patchwork: so I had an amplification fiasco at the soup and tarts thing, which led to me purchasing a proper portable sound reinforcement system (late b'day present to myself)
before the show, Seth Nehil was fucking around with the venue-provided sound system, and broke it
so I volunteered that they could use the battery powered system I brought, with the caveat that it would need new batteries
the tech guy bought me batteries, but did not replace them
so by the time I came on, the batteries were low and the audio was sludgey at high amplitudes
not a total disaster, but really annoying
anyway, as a noise artist it only makes sense that I would have a sound system that can do high SPL, and for my brand of noise I want it to be a clean PA system, not an amp that is designed to complect "tone" with amplification
because fuck their tone
so yeah, total weight of under 40 pounds for a stereo pair, can do 120 db, and the sound is very clean, so I am happy
it can't *sustain* 120db for extended periods, but that's OK. I'm not that much of a sadist to do 120db in the small rooms I perform in.
rant over
I could do it - I assume you mean today?
it would be easy enough to rendesvous somewhere on or near Burnside via bus, I'd be down
patchwork doesn't do brunch, he does lunchfast
emphasis on fast
The rest of the soup and tarts thing was cool. It's an antique building with no indoor plumbing. I got stressed out by the crowd in the dining area so I didn't eat, but I heard it was good. The performances were supposedly all going to be 2 minutes, in reality it was 2-6 minutes with a 2 minute modal duration
it was as you could expect with 40 performances, some were awesome, some less so
one guy was a fashion designer, the performance consisted of a model taking off 6 different robes he designed
finally she did a little turn around to show off her nude body and exit

patchwork: I recorded another concert https://evanspacht.bandcamp.com/album/panting fun starts at 2:40
pretty good, I have been busy with the various contract jobs, got another nice set of mics and other miscelany to make a nice portable harsh-noise rig
went out for chinese last night, overheard halfway through my meal that the restaurant had been without power for 4 hours that day and all nearby restaurants had closed for the day, then puked profusely walking from the restaurant to my train
which is good because I probably would have gotten sick from the unrefrigerated pork otherwise
fuck those guys
funny thing is I didn't get or feel sick. I was walking, and then it was like "OK, throwing up now", then I just resumed.

at this point it isn't fast, and that's kind of the point with graph stuff mostly
though it was cool to come up with a very concise version of djikstra's algo
and maybe on the third or fourth redesign I may have something with decent throughput
https://github.com/noisesmith/adj
the unit tests are probably the informative thing right now https://github.com/noisesmith/adj/blob/master/test/org/noisesmith/adj_test.clj
for example one function makes an infinite lazy seq out of a circular graph
which may or may not ever be useful
sure
also if the graph has multiple cycles, and no terminal nodes, you'll get endless "variation"
which definitely has musical application, yeah
also, the graph representation for synthesis graph creation, of course

so I'm probably doing something with noisesmith.org soon
I set up the DNS and nginx, but no real content yet, except noisesmith.org/noise
dogdog: yes, those are your three weapons
It's going to be a repair manual for clojure code
like the kind of thing where your like "when I go into third gear it makes a sound like 'number can't be cast to ifn'" and it says "yo dude, too many parens"
or whatever
a lot of it will be heuristic - like "these are the most common problems that make that error message happen"
haha
pretty much!
that's where the idea came up
like, I could make a usable web site out of that
I got nginx set up, for now it will be static, so that suffices
well, it's going to have a specific tone and manner of organization
cool deal

they still make crazy noises!
I realized instead of getting a mega looper, I could get a 4 core arm based tablet for less money, and just use an external sound card (which I already have) and a csound patch
I finally figured out that a tablet with the right adaptor attached could use a good sound card
that was the clincher

the funny thing about getting better headphones / speakers is when I put on some pop or rock and realize how little low end it has (compared to jazz or classical or experimental)
it's mastered so it will sound good when people crank up the bass knob on their stereo
so it actually lacks bass so it won't sound like shit when people fuck with it
very funny
also, half the time it totally lacks any true lows (20-40hz octave), because of course the pop audience isn't expected to have speakers that go that low
hah
it's true actually

patchwork: so, the concert last night, Henri Dutilleux is fucking amazing.
"Ainsi la nuit" - let me check
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KUwMjKOkf40
I liked it alot
though I had to put up with ignorant jerks saying it lacked emotion or love for music yadda yadda since I was there alone
(it was performed right before an intermission)
also, I found out I hate Schumann string quartets
the Mozart was of course good
it was like he was doing a string quartet cargo cult style
like "after listening to mozard, haydn, beethoven, I know these elements must be present", but he didn't fucking get it
slightly better than when a rock star orchestrates strings to play major chords following the rythm guitar of their hit song
now I'm listening to Dutilleux again, I think I need to get some of his music
quile: oh hi, you're here

it's a specific CD of dutilleux performances

so if you guys are ever looking for super analytical headphones that reveal every detail of a recording (making good recordings fucking amazing, and bad ones a bit more annoying than they were before), I found a pretty amazing set

today I learned that some cats like the flavor of crickets, and you can amuse them by bringing feeder crickets home and letting them hunt
it's a self-propelled toy and a kitty treat all in one
haha
you can at least be reassured that the cat is likely as oppressed by this situation as you are
perhaps it would be an outdoor toy
"Worst thing about cricket ranching is finding a small enough horse."
this all comes up because crickets taste good and require less water than even beans for a given amount of dietary protein produced
with a bit of terriyaki sauce, they aren't bad

hello
I found a great tool for designing touchscreen controls for softsynths
you've maybe heard of it, touchosc
it's worth the $5
I've been connecting some of my favorite csound synths to it, and it's pretty cool to have multi-touch input
yeah, it's meant for touchscreen usage
it's great on a tablet
has bindings for various daw and synth apps built in
but it's easy to make something custom and connect it
it will work nicely with supercollider (and thus overtone)
indeed
it's funny to be using netcat to debug a synth though
I realized that a) I wanted a new looper and b) for the price of a looper (or less) I could buy a tablet and run csound on it. touchosc has been a bonus for this plan
right now I have a 7 loop multiplex with stereo out and panning for each loop and arbitrary trimming of loop region and overdub -- a bunch of features I would not get for the more expensive dedicated looper pedal
plus if the CPU can keep up I can throw in granulation as well

it's worth having a paid account anyway (for private repos for example) and as a paid user I'd expect them to be helpful
quile: :indent-defun
or :indent-region
quile: all extended commands are run by name via M-x
or via : with evil
so literally you woudl type :indent-region
it will accept tab-completion
you could even do *dent-reg<tab> (asterix works for prefix completion)
the mark command (Control+space in normal emacs) specifies one end of the region, your cursor the other
it should actually be Control-space in spacemacs too

quile: should we be using component-cljs?
for managing multiple stateful aspects of the frontend of our app
OK
that's good to know
OK, I'll try it out. Seems like it would be helpful for our SPA
octobass http://www.thewire.co.uk/video/watch_guro-moe-playing-the-octobass/v=comments
funny when playing such a low instrument that she isn't playing the fundamental but the harmonics
I mean clearly it's because she's a Norweigan improvisor, but still
quile: so should I be using quile/component instead of stuartsierra/component then?
or is it better used alongside?
yeah, I am using component on the backend, but would it work out to just use quile/component on both sides?
instead of using two component impls
yeah, but I am not doing anything advanced, I'll git it a shot
S would be super
unless S itself is a prefix key
and then insertchar would be insert?
one moment
quile: there is a command called insert-char
that is what I use to make snowmen
wouldn't p / P do paste?
on a mac command+v
and the default is Control-y
oh, on this mac Command+v is paste - is this in terminal or gui?
interesting. In my evil mode it does the emacs thing, where if you copied in osx more recently than killing in emacs, the first paste option is the thing from osx
and then you can cycle through the paste ring to get other stuff
I expand my paste ring to have like 50 things in it
after pasting, hit M-y to cycle
and keep hitting M-y until you get the thing you wanted
there may be a more vimy way to cycle
M-x describe-mode is pretty cool
or under evil, :describe-mode I think
(works in my evil, at least)
you can use regular search to find a binding by name in the buffer that describe-mode creates
"C-h m" is the default binding, if spacemacs doesn't clobber it
describe-mode is a good bootstrap
as is apropos
quile: organizing windows is for people who have not attained enlightenment (or those who install winner mode so that they can recover layout history)
or you use winner-mode :)
emacs is from before that new-fangled convention where ux says that if something appears in the UI, it comes back in the same place you last saw it
but winner-mode helps a lot
it gives an undo-history for frame layout
quile: did you forget to deploy quile/component 0.2.4 ?
Could not find artifact quile:component:jar:0.2.4 in clojars (http://clojars.org/repo/)
oh, your project.clj says component-cljs
but your docs say component
so it's a doco bug
yeah
documentation bug
haha
thanks
interesting
all the more reason to get using cljc :)
I've been using cljc, it's great (but 1.7 is not official yet, of course)
I'm actually going to do that update, since it's just one ns, and makes it so I don't have to pull in all cljx's junk
dep madness
that doesn't change my deps though
makes sense
oh, while you're trying emacs, check out the gpg integration. If you make a file foo.org.gpg, it will create a file that defaults to org mode, but gets encrypted when you save it
and decrypted into a buffer when you visit it
it's used for clojars
so you might
setting up a private key is not super hard
D O G D O G D O G
haha, OK
anyway, just using it for local private key encryption is easy with the help of emacs, and it's a cool thing to have
on a mac it integrates with the keyring thing too
use gpg-tools (the point and click install) not gpg from homebrew (by the way)
we set everyone here up with gpg in order to have a private repo on s3
the integration with emacs / the OS is totally borked

it's a very long bodied string instrument with movable bridges
the strings usually silk, and all the same diameter

quile: which means I can mount my EQ, my mixer, and a dedicated audio processing server, all on one portable rack unit
which, needless to say, is awesome
completely eliminates the "laptop on stage" problem
problem being that people see a computer, and decide in a knee-jerk manner that you suck

I spent some quality time last weekend sipping vodka and reading Little Women
right
they have different seasons, different lines
no edits, just the full ride
fun for all ages!
the funny thing is it started because I had a bit much of the recreational weed (leftovers of the same joint I had a few weeks back), and I was like "OK, what's something that will keep me on an even keel - I know trains!" and then spent the rest of the weekend with those vids
lol
the funny thing was, when the video stopped to buffer, it felt like a fast stop - as if I could actually feel the jolt

made a gui to run in the raspi framebuffer (that is, a gui that doesn't use X11, instead the raw framebuffer)

quile: I'm going to try frege one of these days
so, I tried frege!  I found out I was pronouncing it wrong (german is hard) and I found out that though it is awesome, it is lacking a crucial feature: you can't define a class via frege that inherits from a java class or extends a java protocol
which pretty much means I can't use frege :( - except perhaps for writing pure stuff
quile: oh, I thought you were here, I was just saying frege is cool but can't do inheritence / interfaces which means I can't use it
the remarkable thing with frege is how compatible with haskell it is, and that's the downfall - it doesnt' do inheritence or protocols, since it can't express those cleanly in haskell

patchwork: thanks!
patchwork: it was only me, intentionally
patchwork: hey, is there a scary reason we should be aware of that condor wasn't using parallel queries to phoenix and instead making lots of individual ones?
patchwork: just want to double check, sorry to bring up the old job
I'm done
*down
lol
patchwork: no I mean phoenix has a "parallel query" endpoint, and condor was sending individual queries instead of hitting the endpoint that takes bulk requests
err, not endpoint but feature errr something
patchwork: right, just checking if there was an important reason not to be using par, because it looks like phoenix will be much happier if we use it
NUMBERS
patchwork: the deal is it was looping in a pmap and making lots of calls
where all the calls could have gone in one par
and phoenix's load balancer was not handling this gracefully
*is not
OK
aha that's what I was looking for
thanks
patchwork: awesome, exactly what we need to know
patchwork: large dog is using your standing desk floor pad to rest on
patchwork: that pool is shared with other functionality too right?
actually I recently started a lib using manifold to adjust parallelization / backpressure / throughput limits independent of pooling of threads
patchwork: oh, cool
patchwork: manifold allows wrapping a channel to control throughput and backpressure using a higher level declarative style (rather than making it a side effect of some other mechanism), which is kind of cool
so two things can use the same pool of threads, but have different limits on how much they try to use
but that makes it simpler if there's a pool that is only used for that thing
patchwork: oh, and also, I found the idiom for using threads inside core.async but only for things that will block / be long running. (>/go (loop [...] (<! (>/thread (f x)) ...)) - the idea here is that the go loop is only parked (so not consuming a thread pool thread) and the individual worker threads are each created as needed from the future pool
of course you would bind the (>/<! ...) to some value in a let block if you needed the result of f
but even if you don't consume the value, still call <! because that is what makes sure you park instead of blocking
oh wait, that just ensures it parks and applies backpressure instead of aggressively creating threads, my bad

patchwork: yo!
patchwork: I'm still on that diet, lost 20 pounds in the first month, didn't expect the numbers to be that close to the prediction
1,200 calories a day, no other rules
which supposedly leads to losing 5 pounds a week, for me that is 100% accurate
only for the first week
actually I was only dizzy one morning
no pain, just some discomfort that I quickly became less attuned to
same as before but exactly half the amount, pretty much
carrying tupperware so I can shovel half in before I even start eating if I go to a restaurant
also it helps a lot to get frozen food that isn't complete crap because that makes keeping track of the calories and controlling the portions much easier
it's basically a big exercise in willpower, but most of the time it is OK and if I just freak out and start shoving food in my face I can just account for that and have something smaller later
it's a budget like any other
(but one that is attached to intense animalistic states)
heh
pretty much what I was eating before - 2400 or so, maybe less because I'm carrying less by then
and if I notice I'm gaining weight, I adjust
there's numbers on the inputs, and numbers for the result, so the algorithm is simple :) it's just the willpower part that takes work
and you need to stick to whatever experiment you try for a week to really know what it did (there's too much noise in the day to day numbers)
I think what happens with many diets is people try to make rules to distract from the primary issue (dealing with feeling hungry), and some people find that helpful, but to me it just makes the whole thing more complicated without making the willpower part easier
another trick is psyllium - tastes weird but makes one feel "full"
that can help with the waking up with grumbling guts issue

OK, about to deploy this huge auto-upgrade-with-stripe thing, which has been an adventure - first I tried to do it all (which was a lot of work) then backed up and tried to get the minimum to make it work, then found out I actually needed the whole deal, then finally as we were about to deploy found out they didn't want like half the features.
typical stuff really

I could do either, sure
sounds great, I hope you can come to this neighborhood?
cool, awesome, see you then
quile: can't seem to get you and patchwork in here at the same time. We're meeting for lunch on Thursday downtown.
np, patchwork was mostly not around when he was unemployed too, so it's been pretty dead around here
I'm still happily on the vim train
haven't even bothered
I never used nrepl with emacs either, cider is crap
and vim uses cider (or big parts of it) too
nothing!
that is, I use clojure's built in facilities for reloading and evaluating code, without editor integration
it's actually quite straightforward
(require 'whatever.ns :reload), or for something outside the project (load-file "/path/to/file.clj")
I tend to write code in the repl, then move it into the source when it works (except for trivial stuff where I don't need to try it first)
haha https://twitter.com/TheLincoln/status/708714132002967552
I've never had it behaving correctly
every update to the latest code breaks things
errors when trying to update, not handling cljc properly, not handling defrecords properly, not reloading correctly...
I just did a hard-switch from merzbow to bach on my playlist

quile: the above is my favorite vim alias right now
saves state of all windows, reloads the files from disk, reloads state of all windows, then updates state of vimrc
heh, there's always ex mode
I like leader bindings because it allows me to eliminate the chord key combos
which is my motivation for using vi anyway, never using chords if I can help it
quile: my trick is to ssh to my vps and leave a reverse tunnel open, then I can ssh through the chain of tunnels to use work machine from home / home machine from work
ssh -L 2223:127.0.0.1:2222 -R 2223:127.0.0.1:22 justin@noisesmith.org # two way tunnels!
then you flip the 2223 / 2222 on the other end
patchwork: definitely
I also had open ended plans to lunch with kutruff this week, and mentioned that we were meeting today but I don't think she'll be joining us

patchwork: I'm learning zookeeper stuff, and doing some mild refactoring of ibis.zookeeper (pulling out the get and convert actions because to use compare-and-set I need to access them separately)
I'm continuing to like zookeeper
patchwork: also, I learned that (apply f (cons e coll)) is never needed - (apply f e coll) does the same thing!
patchwork: it is how apply has always worked, and makes constructing calls to apply much more readable
but if you hate it I will avoid making that change in ibis.zookeeper/with-reconnect :)
patchwork: is it crazy to turn (defn with-reconnect [f zookeeper & args] (try (apply f @(:connection zookeeper) args) (catch Exception e (reconnect zookeeper) (apply f @(:connection zookeeper) args)))) into (defn with-reconnect [f zookeeper & args] (try (apply f @(:connection zookeeper) args) (catch Exception e (reconnect zookeeper) (with-reconnect f zookeeper args))))
ugh, that doesn't work as a one liner
and it is bad because that's a very eager catch, that would cause an infinite loop on a legit error

patchwork: ibis question - how do you feel about abstracting the zookeeper (and maybe also kafka) stuff into a separate utility lib - at least the parts that are not ibis specific? I am finding I to use that functionality in things that don't need ibis itself
I could also make this a convo on the ibis repo on github
patchwork: yeah, we could pr that - for some of the stuff at least
patchwork: perhaps if with-reconnect were abstracted so that the method of reconnecting, and the method of extracting the connection, were not reliant on the data being an atom (instead a protocol that could be extended to atoms as well as other things?)
just a thought
that's the one thing that makes it too concrete for clj-zookeeper Ithink, and with a protocol, people could swap in their own preferred way of managing state
right, so define a protocol with get-connection and change-connection methods
whatever they want! haha
but supply the atom one as a reasonable default
a ref, a var, an agent, all would work
maybe, maybe it's still too specific for that lib
I'll think about it more, it's not a rush
prismofeverything/zookeeperkeeper
or maybe zookeeperzoo
definitely
check complete, latency increased
haha

OT: I found a delightfully mathematical book - the categorical dual of the abridged "Moby Dick", titled "; or the whale" - http://www.amazon.com/The-Review-Contemporary-Fiction-Special/dp/1564785904?ie=UTF8&psc=1&redirect=true&ref_=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s00
patchwork: that's awesome
"This book is the reciprocal of the abridged edition, and it reads as a collection of my favorite passages from "Moby-Dick, or, the Whale" -- just imagine, every blessed line and punctuation mark in this was removed from the abridged edition! The very heart of the book is over here."
dickens, blah, yeah
patchwork: in particular, type systems make refactors much less error prone
patchwork: I talked to matthias, who wrote the little schemer, when I was at clojure/west. he thinks I should do a talk about mentoring clojure. his talk was about the pitfalls of typing a lisp.
it was interesting (though some of its claims are very weird to me)
patchwork: so I got "clojure for machine learning", "clojure for data science" and "clojure data analysis cookbook"
large and comprehensive
in the "clojure for data science" book, the example for loom / graph analysis is a bunch of analysis of twitter follower data
including generating some visualizations of the network properties (connectedness etc.()
people who need more than just a graph of connectedness vs. edge
but it has examples of calculating/displaying metrics we don't yet calculate/display, which is cool
and a shitload of techniques
spearmans, k-means - all kinds of methods, some I have heard of and others I have not, so - I'll be reading for a while
right, exactly
and likely replace some existing code with something smaller using existing data science libs, which might also be helpful
patchwork: yeah, that's where I recognized the name from
patchwork: there's a bunch - incanter, loom, tesser
I mean I guess they are not all strictly data science, but can be combined to do data science stuff, of course
tesser looks cool https://github.com/aphyr/tesser
patchwork: this is all from a quick browse on the book, I'll definitely need to experiment and evaluate of course
but these are the things used in the book examples

so, in the past couple of weeks I have learned about the value of using plumatic/schema at system boundaries - and also I converted a kafka topic based job dispatch (fifo) with one that scans for jobs in mongo, and picks the best one to do next
quile: kafka is great once I grokked it, but mongo lets us have a "pool" of tasks, and use priority logic to pick one, whereas kafka would just give you the next one down the pipe
since it's just request/response we don't need great durability here, so it's a nice fit for mongo

patchwork: I just put a big pr on ibis https://github.com/littlebird/ibis/pull/1/files
patchwork: tl;dr counting the number of discreet segments currently being run in the cluster, with compare+set and atomic change operations to ensure the counts are accurate
err. Discrete, of course, I always get that one wrong
I also broke up a 1000 line function to some smaller functions
(it wasn't really 1000 lines)
great, thanks
yeah, it could be a separate lib I think
littlebird/falconer
haha
patchwork: update about that PR - it's going to need to be grouped by ibis-id because the finally can fail to run if the jvm is killed :(
I'
ll update when it's clojure to correctness though
I'll probably need to integrate with zookeeper's client tracking or the heartbeat thing
ROFL "clojure to correctness"

it is true, I'm the hookup for testing
I got a commit accepted into csound, that will be in the next release (going out in a few days)
it's just error checking and a message (replacing a segfault caused by a bad parameter argument), but hey, it will likely save someone else the 30 minutes of debugging I went through
yes, that too

no, I have not, I had tentative plans to see it with gillbo and rj, but they weren't able to make time over the weekend

or just me if nobody makes it again :P
I'd be down
they are out of town though, but that's not a huge deal I don't think
awesome! let's do it
patchwork: just put it on my calendar, see you guys then
oh, thanks
wow
