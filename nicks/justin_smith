ad hoc snowman machine
it is like hodor, or a pokemon
primarily spends its time saying its own name
so now it listens to everything?
it has stolen my soul

careful where you put it, it may have puppies

DAMN TRICKY

I have trained my dogdog to not make sense
dogdog is always good for a laugh
does Budha have the dogdog nature?
/msg dogdog (defn resize-image++
  [image opts]
  (if-not (config/draw :aws :bucket)
    (resize-image image opts)
    (let [path (asset/asset-location image)
          asset-root (config/draw :assets :dir)
          lichen-path (string/join "/" ["" lichen/lichen-root path])
          queries (lichen/query-string opts)
          target (lichen/lichen-uri lichen-path queries "")
err
OK
if we feed it enough code, it can do our work
dogdog makes more sense than the input I have been giving it

patchwork: I want to use some text I pull in from the db as the basis for a template for a render - is there an example I can see for doing that?
I know that a template is actually a function taking a map, how do I create that function using antlers with an arbitrary input string at runtime?
cool, thanks yo
now to put that in some docs somewhere

yeah, that worked out great, but rythmbox (the ubuntu iTunes clone) was just too slow to be usable
really, just having that much ram for disk cache is pretty sweet if nothing else
and it shines with audio (editing big multitrack audio projects, real time multi-looping)
if only I could make flashplayer show a video full screen in one display while I do other shit in the other one
and if only compiz was not a buggy piece of shit (I had to switch to e17)
well compiz is ok until you try to customize things
that's when it becomes a buggy piece of shit

UGH no attachments in postmark?
DUH
I will have to look into that
I wish I had checked this sooner
looks like our fork of clojure-postmark will be seeing a new feature
While I am at it I am going to add an &arg for arbitrary key / vals to send to postmark
