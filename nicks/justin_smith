I have trained my dogdog to not make sense
dogdog is always good for a laugh
does Budha have the dogdog nature?
/msg dogdog (defn resize-image++
  [image opts]
  (if-not (config/draw :aws :bucket)
    (resize-image image opts)
    (let [path (asset/asset-location image)
          asset-root (config/draw :assets :dir)
          lichen-path (string/join "/" ["" lichen/lichen-root path])
          queries (lichen/query-string opts)
          target (lichen/lichen-uri lichen-path queries "")
err
OK
if we feed it enough code, it can do our work
dogdog makes more sense than the input I have been giving it

patchwork: I want to use some text I pull in from the db as the basis for a template for a render - is there an example I can see for doing that?

yeah, that worked out great, but rythmbox (the ubuntu iTunes clone) was just too slow to be usable
really, just having that much ram for disk cache is pretty sweet if nothing else
and it shines with audio (editing big multitrack audio projects, real time multi-looping)
if only I could make flashplayer show a video full screen in one display while I do other shit in the other one
and if only compiz was not a buggy piece of shit (I had to switch to e17)
well compiz is ok until you try to customize things

call for proposals: should postmark expect attachments to be base64 (which is what the underlying library expects) or should it automagically convert non-string-args to base64 strings (ie. if it gets a java.io.File should it suck up the file and base64 encode it or just throw an error?)

patchwork: I am trying to figure out how to import the dev db but not import any changes to asset fields - any hints?
OK, this is terra incognita for me, but that sounds reasonable
ahh, yeah, of course
my real problem will be figuring out what to import and what not to import
hell, I could do a full dump via model api as edn, and pick out what needs importing
yes
mostly just model actually
the content could be filled in, the model stuff is the important part
I am realizing I can load up the other config in the repl, and compare them via repl model interaction
patchwork: yes, we do need a general method for this
I am going to do what I did with syl and start writing migrations
it was easier with syl because nobody else was editing models, so I just did all my changes as migrations from the very beginning
DUDE
patchwork: do we have a function that does diffs on nested maps?
args to update-in!
return a lazy seq of update-in vectors paired with prev/new values?
yes, but the args to update in are trivially transformable to the model operations you would want
and a good default format
or maybe I am missing something here
I am thinking breadth first, starting with model differences, going down to deeper differences if you ask for them
because of course the output could be rediculous, but a good coding would expose them as they are asked for and often once you get the first few model differences that would often be all you really need from the tool (other changes not being important)
this is arbitrary depth
but breadth first would likely be most useful, since the data has a human consumer
oh yeah
so the important thing is to show model differences first
then content differences other than updated at / created at
I think?
yeah
but with a smart ordering you could just pick a dividing line, use all changes before that, discard all after that
