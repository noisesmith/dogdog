call for proposals: should postmark expect attachments to be base64 (which is what the underlying library expects) or should it automagically convert non-string-args to base64 strings (ie. if it gets a java.io.File should it suck up the file and base64 encode it or just throw an error?)

patchwork: I am trying to figure out how to import the dev db but not import any changes to asset fields - any hints?
OK, this is terra incognita for me, but that sounds reasonable
ahh, yeah, of course
my real problem will be figuring out what to import and what not to import
hell, I could do a full dump via model api as edn, and pick out what needs importing
yes
mostly just model actually
the content could be filled in, the model stuff is the important part
I am realizing I can load up the other config in the repl, and compare them via repl model interaction
patchwork: yes, we do need a general method for this
I am going to do what I did with syl and start writing migrations
it was easier with syl because nobody else was editing models, so I just did all my changes as migrations from the very beginning
DUDE
patchwork: do we have a function that does diffs on nested maps?
args to update-in!
return a lazy seq of update-in vectors paired with prev/new values?
yes, but the args to update in are trivially transformable to the model operations you would want
and a good default format
or maybe I am missing something here
I am thinking breadth first, starting with model differences, going down to deeper differences if you ask for them
because of course the output could be rediculous, but a good coding would expose them as they are asked for and often once you get the first few model differences that would often be all you really need from the tool (other changes not being important)
this is arbitrary depth
but breadth first would likely be most useful, since the data has a human consumer
oh yeah
so the important thing is to show model differences first
then content differences other than updated at / created at
I think?
yeah
but with a smart ordering you could just pick a dividing line, use all changes before that, discard all after that

http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBmiZpGvnYY on youtube
I got it via amazon mp3
what are the odDs
if all http related functionality should be in frontend, does that mean s3 should be a frontend overlay on top of core?
yeah - my attitude is that frontend should not even be checking if assets are on disk or s3 - it should call the wrapper that farms out at the caribou.asset level
I could build in some more user friendly s3 specific stuff on the lichen side though
looks like I will be able to generalize s3-resize so input could be an image in your own s3 bucket, or could be at some other arbitrary URL, and the resized ends up under the bucket (and will be looked up if you ask for the same input / options again)
3♠

(some are standalone mp3s of pieces, others in subdirs named after albums)
patchwork: logistics! in s3, should I still be abstracting out the asset root before generating the hash, or can we count on people changing buckets rather than asset roots within a bucket?
instead, I am taking the s3 url, chopping it into constituent strings via regex, pushing in the lichen stuff in the right spots via string concatenation, etc.
patchwork: another question: lichen-resize returns a java.io.File, that is impossible for lichen-resize-s3 - do I return a socket that is ready for a .read operation for compatibility maybe?
"AmazonS3Exception: Status Code: 400, AWS Service: Amazon S3, AWS Request ID: 3AA8153E4C84D6C1, AWS Error Code: RequestTimeout, AWS Error Message: Your socket connection to the server was not read from or written to within the timeout period. Idle connections will be closed."
patchwork: any idea what would make s3/put-object not read or write to the stream?

(problem was a size header larger than the image output, turns out s3 rejects such things)
quile: it turns out that a few of the #clojure folks are NZ based clojure web devs
another thing: s3 gripes that we don't specify an upload size for the resizes
if I give the size of the input the whole operation fails because what is sent is too short, and s3 decides that was an arbitrary error and bails out
(model/impose :luch-plan {:where {:date (java.util.Date.)}})
{{environment}} {{^= environment :development }}NOT DEV{{/= environment :development }}
prints :development NOT DEV
thomas had an awesome suggestion for s3 assets: protocol relative links
when no height or width is specified, the s3 upload is handed nil instead of a handle to read bytes from!

I was thinking, alternately, of trying it with the Disruptor lib
also, somewhat related, it may make sense to have a more generic "how to upload a resize remotely" config, instead of specializing in parallel on local / s3
like config could have a "lichen store cache" function, which creates a file as a default, then we can provide a "upload to s3" option, and others could be plugged in (ftp to asset server, whatever)

"java.io.EOFException: Unexpected end of ZLIB input stream" could it be trying to unzip the file before the file is completely created? I guess that makes sense because when you scp it starts as a 0 byte file, then gets appended to
alt tab moves linearly (in one direction) across things in a two dimensional space (three dimensional in a standard workspace that does not tile) - it is more useful to move via alt-arrow in the direction of the window you want
so (swap caribou.logger/loggers conj [7 (fn [level s] (println (Date.) " : " (string/upper-case (name level)) ": " s))])
better than what I suggested above: (swap! caribou.logger/loggers conj (fn [level message] (caribou.logger/stdoutlog level (str (Date.) " - " message))))

it could be used, just has an unneeded conditional since assets will all be s3

patchwork: https://github.com/zavg/Asis <- run it in a working codebase, it tools things to generate tests, keep the tests, then refactor code and see if they pass
we should totally do this with caribou
if we generate the tests from site FOO, and the tests pass with the new caribou version, than FOO will work when we upgrade caribou versions
basically record / replay for app state come to think of it
oh, shit, it is a php tool - it needs to be rewritten in clojure :)
heh
the concept is straightforward
it ties into that same thing I was talking with technomancy about, recording requests in order to replay
add to that some tooling / tracing
...
should be doable as a middleware
anyway, I passed asis along to some of our poor longsuffering php using comrades
D O G D O G D O G D O G
patchwork: so here's my concept for a replay middleware: for each request it generates a form, that if eval'ed will generate a duplicate of the request
this is because the request can contain stateful objects like request bodies
you can eval the form to replay the request into your handler for debugging
you can copy the form into a unit test, to save at and test future versions against it
if not for the unit test part I would just generate a function of course
I think so
it could be a handler, just put it at the bottom, so it gets the most raw version of the request
the tricky extra bit is some bugs also rely on state of the db etc., which is of course not generalizable
you can't serialize a db connection state, without something like datomic
D O G D O G
I was just thinking we could have had that conversation in here

dodog, just don't ever say OGC, because that is obscene
I just did a postwalk, and got the class of everything in the request map for 45 requests: #{nil org.eclipse.jetty.server.HttpInput clojure.lang.PersistentVector java.lang.Integer clojure.lang.PersistentArrayMap clojure.lang.Keyword java.lang.String clojure.lang.PersistentHashMap}
so teh HttpInput is the one tricky one I guess? everything else is immutible
working on making that serializable (thinking of a scheme using byte-array and io/copy, should be easy enough, base64 so it can be in a source file as part of a unit test)
he is obsessed with s3, and validity
I was imagining that the binary explosion monad gave form to pope trapezoid
and pope trapezoid got a vasectomy
patchwork: http://sprunge.us/jdAM?clojure I am getting all the requests, encoding their body to base64, and storing it in the request map serialization - the next step is to call the handler on it for replay
the tricky part was replicating the body to another stream, while also having a copy of it that was just a string to munge
I should wrap it up in a tee-stream function
eh maybe it is not working properly actaully it appears the post body is not coming through :(

I am now officially a paredit user
groundhog now has default methods to store, sanitize, and replay requests
and an opts map to provide alternatives for each
replay is done by default with a magic /replay/<count> URL which triggers a replay if the request comes from localhost

but will also work as a standalone ring handler
patchwork: cool, I hope to put some time into it after I have this handler too

so, over the weekend someone at jenkins ran a script that did a git push -f, and it totally destroyed a bunch of the repos jenkins owns on github
there is something very ironic and sad about this
patchwork: if github allowed access to the remote upstream, they could find it in a reflog
if they looked before a gc happened
patchwork: some of them do, not the guy who made the mistake
so hundreds of their repos got forced commits of old versions of the repo
from a guy who never pulled, so he did not have the refs locally to fix the issue
yeah, but it's more complicated than it could have been, since they don't have direct access to their main repo
of course github recommends having few devs with push rights to a repo, and using pull requests, but jenkins was just giving commit access to everyone
but, reading about this, I learned about reflog, and its ability to help you find orphaned HEADS for recovery
which is cool!
if they just made the script do a full fetch before pushing, even if it ignored upstream contents and force pushed it would at least have the refs needed to restore anything it fucked up
patchwork: yeah, sure thing

patchwork: did you just tell me to update the README, and then immediately do it yourself?
I'll merge in my updates too
OK, I was surprised to update, and then get a merge conflict :)
usage has not changed, though it could be expanded on
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/clojure is this where you submitted the caribou announcement?
heh
you didn't mention #antler
yo
wassup
patchwork: still there?
so bitemyapp had some constructive criticism, if you didn't see
our usage of specials in with-config and wrap-request are likely to cause problems with async because special vars are per-thread
a workaround in the short term could be to pass that bound value in any async call
except with http-kit
with http-kit you could see issues sooner, since it is implicitly async
yeah, on #clojure
it's good to find out this way instead of from a bug in production, but I don't think there is an easy fix
the straightforward way to do it safely would be to add a config argument to *everything* in caribou
which would kind of suck
for example if you have a websocket
heh
no, its just in the template when the app is created
that's all
not the very latest, no
so the special var bindign issue would be for example in httpkit, you open a socket, and the thread that serves it is not neccissarily in the same binding context as the one that created it
since binding is a per-thread thing
or if you did polling on input (as the version of lichen that does indeterminate s3 upload does)
one of our handlers in caribou.app
thats the one
we can't take for granted the request is handled all in one thread
so that could break
cool, yeah, it didn't seem so familiar
so, I wonder - how big a change would it be to put config in the request map instead of a special var, and then pass it to the functions that use it (or use functions that use it)?
maybe that is just too much of a pain in the ass
but it is the cleanest, behavior wise
the second best being let over lambda, using config to return configured versions of each function
which means changing less code maybe
but then you can't just use namespaces in an idiomatic way
will it always be?
I guess if we can take that for granted, worst case is you end up in a thread without config bound
is everything guaranteed to be spawned from the handler?
I suggest asking bitemyapp some of these questions, he is surly, but he has a good eye for the unforeseen consequences
what I mean, is anything going to start other from in init
then it won't be bound
not sure - I am mostly passing along the concern second hand from bitemyapp
he was pretty convincing, but you are also
you may want to go to the source
as I mentioned earlier today, his hobby horse is proper reentrancy, and clean reproducible non-global config
yeah
and I think his argument is that it should be possible to have k configs
that do not interfere with one anotehr
*one another
and that is where the mess happens, potentially
if any async crosses the config boundary
I am not sure it would
http-kit, he says, makes it so you cannot take for granted your request is handled in one thread
though with our model, everything would be handled under the config gathered up in init
more than one, I think
but I am not the expert
I use it for preparing migrations
debugging a bad change to a schema
but none of that should be in a request handling context
I think his claim rests on the fact that due to the async nature of http-kit, your request could be passed between multiple threads as it polls for client data
yeah, that was the one he pointed out
wait, what was the thing with immutant you thought was fixed?
right
I think it was similar to the search indexing where I needed to override some function from a caribou ns to pull it out
I will have to retrace my steps
what about having an immutant-handler and a non-immutant one?
the immutant handler could be in a mini-lib that is separated off in order to isolate the dep
that is where immutant would be, right, in the default handler?
right, so that could be isolated - a mini alternative handler for immutant maybe?
if that is so heave a dep that it needs isolating
definitely
very similar issue to the search-indexing
nice to support, but can it be done easily in a way that is not intrusive for opting out
no, I just replace the code that invokes it
I don't know, because I take it out knowing I won't be using it on tomcat
maybe it is more specifically a beanstalk issue
I will have to sort that out, I should keep copious notes when I create new sites!
the issue is it uses the disk
if it is not referring to a directory outside the app, it gets clobbered with a new deploy
right
hell, it is even hypothetically possible on beanstalk
I was talking to a web dev on #clojure who was talking about integrating s3 assets / local assets workflows
I was realizing that there could be a middleware that abstracts over local disk vs. s3
based on what we do in lichen, but making it a separate concern
ie. if you want to serve up objects locally in dev, and from s3 on prod, and just know it would be handled identically
the middleware could abstract the differences away
well there is the dual of access, which is the storage
but of course we could abstract over both
I'm gonna have to call it a night
see you tomorrow
nice
he's been here for a while
we should direct future caribou talk from #clojure to here if it starts getting more active
yeah, my thoughts exactly
patchwork: clojure.walk2 disappeared from the clojuresphere (in terms of maven accessibility) with the exception of the caribou fork!
we should put your walk2 repo that I am sure is on your box up on github, so we can at least let people verify the version before requiring it
it would be the polite thing
the author retracted his jars
I assume in the same way a turtle retracts his limbs
well the fork is on clojars
lol
lein search clojure.walk2
the only result is caribou/clojure.walk2
sierra I think
you obviously forked it at some point, now it is the only readily available version
well, we could retract ours in sympathy, and break a shitload of code assumedly
people are fixing their code that stuartsierra broke by retracting his lib by pulling in our version
YES
THE SAME DUDE
so we are doing the world a favor by mirroring his lib, but it would be nice if we also shared the codebase behind it as open source citizens
erm...
our repo is not up there, but you pushed ajar
*a jar
lein search clojure.walk2
you could fork his github and make that the new jar
walk2 is still on git, just the jar is not out there it seems
this is the same guy who fucked all the clojure.data.json users
wait, did something similar happen with tools.namespace?
he pulled the lib because it was accepted as a patch to clojure proper
to replace clojure.walk in the next clojure version I guess
but that doesn't help people using old versions
sweet!
nice feedback
for r/clojure 25 karma is a lot
sweet
forks this soon, awesome
probably taking immutant out :)
it's cool to be compatible, if only there was an easy way to make it opt in

fixed the spelling
seems useful for catching intermediates concisely
so you don't need to turn a one liner into a let
or for debugging, at that
reducers have something called reductions
that return the intermediate values at each step, right?

patchwork: windows shit
heh
windows is so weird
it is hard to differentiate actual apps from malware
maybe because I am so used to malware imitating windows
but I got lein and git and caribou all working
and mostly verified my path fix
oh, that
the site takes a long time to load on first visit
because the page is like hundreds of jpegs
(that is what I think the reason is)
but we are using nginx / varnish / s3, so I think my ducks are in a row
we may want to look into loading the images more lazily
http://teague-staging.elasticbeanstalk.com/
OK, got that sorted out, let's look at schmetterling
github pooped all over the teague repo ;(
the page is a 500
the repo does not respond
it pooped on it
just created a teague2 for the interem
indeed
I guess it could have beeen a worse kind of poop
like if pulling replaced the entire set of references with garbage
heh
heh, yeah
you know, Leeeeeeroooooy Jenkins would totally do a git push -f
on 4000 repos at once
awesome!
so you just need to make sure clojure.jar is in the target classpath, and then you can use clojure to debug DTC
wow, the continued responses to that "do dev apps need caribou" thread make us look really good
congrats patchwork, the world is exposed to your genius

patchwork: (clojure.repl/source-fn 'clojure.repl/source-fn) -> returns the source as a string
patchwork: also if you look at the source for source-fn, you can see how to ask for a random resource and get an arbitrary range of line numbers from it
which could be useful for a lazy interactive browser (get a few more lines as they scroll maybe)
quile: you around?
 it was about this thread on the clojure mailing list: https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/clojure/MzBnqDsV3wc I made a branch to move templates under templates/_admin
I caught all the usage of partials, and all the lookup of templates in controllers (I think), but the asset picker now looks for _admin/... without the preceding templates/ which doesn't reflect any change I made, and of course breaks that UI
I am guessing it broke some javascript magic, and you don't have to fix it, but a lead to what makes this happen so I could fix it would be awesome
if you have any
do you know where in the js I would look for things that generated a template location
?
OK
the templates are clean
I will double check the controllers
yeah I got all of those already
and template/find-template inserts templates/
something is not inserting templates/
that is why I suspected js
especially suspicious is replacing templates/ with _admin/
that makes me think bad js regex or something :)
but thanks anyway for the suggestions, this isn't urgent at all, and I may figure it out after all
it would be a nice to have for sure
heh
on that branch?
cool!
I wonder what I fucked up on my local
awesome
well thanks for proving I'm somehow a dumbass then :)
I'll figure out what I did wrong locally, and continue from there, thanks

I got my first "any caribou guys around?" on #clojure this morning
(it was the guy getting the old version of fs via lighttable
I suggested he try lein pedantic and some :exclusions clauses
then I didn't hear from him again
right, that was my thought
still our version of fs seems to be up to date
so I picked up this video game called "luxuria superbia"
you fly through an abstract flower and paint the petals
it is totally obscene without any explicit content
the flower starts pulsing when you fill in enough of the colors
but if you fill it in completely, too fast, the flower tells you "oh, that's too bad, but it's ok, this kind of thing happens to everyone sometimes"
to get a high score you have to keep painting the petals (by stroking the flower buds inside(?) but not too quickly - just the right pace
like I said, totally obscene
I was just about to ask you how to turn on query cache, but instead I googled it
we have finally reached the point where I can google caribou questions and get a good answer instead of asking your directly
eventually I'll just be asking google where you want to go for lunch
https://github.com/noisesmith/quad-tree <- readme, with an image in it even
and the basics work (now for traversal and search)
the svg lib I found makes debugging graphic stuff pretty simple
since in inkscape each polygon is its own object I can inspect for geometry and even arbitrary properties (hypothetically)
let's make a 3d data structure visualizer with an oculus rift + kinekt UI
for hollywood style debugging
I know we could totally do it
add a canvas to schmetterling
the trick would be the data structure rendering - we could make plugins
hashmap, vector, list
even showing the internal structure if we are ambitious enough to
yes
I can't believe I waited this long to turn on query cache
it should be there by default in production.clj
I am doing that edit right fucking ow
*now
maybe, checking
does the template use caribou development still?
is reloading something I have to turn off explicitly?
OK, this google search is not properly optimized yet: "caribou turn off template reload"
OK, I put it in explicitly anyway
doesn't hurt?
anyway, pushing the query-cache option to caribou-development / develop
or should I push to our lein-template?
one thing I got working in teague that is a cantidate for caribou: a model in the db for remote resized resources
so the caching can happen at a db level
so if cached in ram, use that, then check db, and use that and propagate to ram, then check remote, and propagate to db and ram, or create the remote, then propagate to db and ram
this is just for the location of the asset / the fact it exists
it seemed like extra complexity at first, but adding that layer makes the first few page loads much nicer
speaking of prewarming, is there a way to force all the routing and such to build before the first request comes through? I don't think that level of laziness is actually helpful
yes, and then something loads verbosely (and time consumingly) with the first request
maybe not the routes but all the controllers being evaluated?
it is just this initial load that could be happening when the app first goes live
instead it make the first request take 20 seconds to get served
*makes
not slowing
if I wait 10 hours between the boot and loading a page, the big chunk of processing happens then
the printed messages are about defining the routes
erm...
on prod I am
and that first request takes a while on prod
yes
and if that was the issue, we would see the hit every time
but it is just the first page load
there is clearly some code that is not getting hit until the handler actually runs
right
maybe it is the way handler is defined
whatever it is, it would be nice if that big chunk of work could happen at app boot, and not wait for a request to come in
could be an old thing that already got fixed
just incidentally
I'll look into it again if I see it on the next site
patchwork: the cookie handler I set up for admin seems to set a cookie for every request, which may be interfering with varnish
I wonder if there is a straightforward way to only set the cookie for admin usage? or should we be setting a cookie for every visitor
maybe the middleware I am using for the cookies is fucked up
or maybe I am misenterpreting the response header preview in chrome

clojure macro of the day: as->
(as-> {:❄ 0 :✈ 1} ☃ (assoc ☃ :🌰 ☃) (update-in ☃ [:❄] inc) (into {} (map (fn [[k v]] (if (number? v) [k (inc v)] [k v])) ☃)))
it is like -> but you can explicitly decide where the arg gets substituted
heh
above code evaluates to {:🌰 {:❄ 0, :✈ 1}, :❄ 2, :✈ 2}
kara just asked me to invent a password, I don't know if she realizes what she is getting herself into
CACHING ISSUES
the frontend sees 503 that is not reflected on the caribou side at all :(
UGH
well I hope it is that simple
plan: remove varnish, serve nginx directly
create  a new ec2 instance to debug all varnish issues
sound good?
patchwork: not varnish
there is 500 with no corresponding output
patchwork: one is beanstalk, the other ec2
there is actually no way to turn off indexing
I thought it was turned off, it was just failing semi-gracefully on beanstalk
and breaking catastrophically on ec2
yes
but not having it should be an option
I guess I could have set /dev/null as my indexing dir
we probably can
I was prioritizing, and they did not ask for search
so I foolishly thought not having it was the simpler option
hey patchwork did you find out or-> is a clean fix for needing functions in the -> macro?
it is pretty cool
(as-> {:❄ 0 :✈ 1} ☃ (assoc ☃ :🌰 ☃) (update-in ☃ [:❄] inc) (into {} (map (fn [[k v]] (if (number? v) [k (inc v)] [k v])) ☃)))
it lets you pick the symbol, and explicitly place it at any nesting in each form
you are only binding one symbol
in this case ☃
it translates to (let [☃ (...) ☃ (...) ☃ (...) ☃ (...) ] ☃)
right
with the layout of ->
similar for immutant
it is easier to make things default than optional
right
it comes up because it is a big download
and used to be an intermittent error
(random stack traces from not finding part of the immutant setup, as far as I know that part is gone now)
right
patchwork: another clojure easter egg (this a silly one): (keyword "-)")
OH SHIT
for now, I can create /var/lib/tomcat7/caribou-index]

patchwork: what is the best way for me to get one table's updates from one db to another without breaking things
I moved the assets over from one bucket to the other, now I need the corresponding asset objects to exist in the db
but I have had bad luck with partial dumps / loads
and that would properly import them with the right id?
because the id is magic with assets
OK, I'll figure something else out then
patchwork: what do you think of adding Cache-Control http headers to s3 assets by default?
cache-control prevents the client from downloading the image anew on every page load
basically it is a promise that this object will not change within some period of time
s/prevents the client from/allows the client not to
otherwise the browser is pessimistic and grabs the thing each time in case it changed since last reload
ralfonso: what is a reasonable cache-control setting? 100 years? 1 day?
also, for most images, adding a cache-control of public would be good too
public tells any other server that no matter how many users ask for face.jpg they will all get the same file
cache-control: forward-from-grandma
every computer user is assumed to already have this content on disk
nice
we should make multiple tagged non-intrusive trace panels
each panel gets a name, so you can do (schmetterling/trace request :top) and that traces the value of request to the top panel
then you can just create arbitrary numbers of panels for output, and categorize what traces to each one
maybe - that may require some magic
it's just a parameterized print
print this value, plus print it in that location

oh cool
we doing clojure today?
we could try integrating my quad tree lib, which should be cljs compatible (except for the svg rendering part, which is unneeded in cljs)
insertion works, and I have a walk function, but some of the search functions are not in there yet
a deep walk is not really the way to search a quad tree :)
we would write a directional search that would start with a given path to a point in a quad tree and find the next item in a specific direction that matched some predicate
in order to measure gaps, find neighbors, find closer packings, etc.
what works already is checking if points are occupied, and inserting to create the occupied structure if they are clear
which is already potentially useful
(reducing the number of comparisons, in exchange for the extra quad tree branches created)
yeah, absolutely

patchwork: what is the current story with model and content migration?
patchwork: cool
cool
sounds like the right thing
I just ordered a copy of that "high performance clojure" book that just came out
patchwork: lunch today? it's been a while, between my long weekends and teague shit
csound now runs inside pnacl
so you can serve up a synthesizer as a web page, all the c code is translated to javascript
and do the UI in html
I will have to do this with clojurescript
also, people area working on hooking clojurescript into the javascript support in the newest OSX and IOS
*are working on
yes we do
also, if it looks like a change needs to be done to weareinstrument do I just jump in and fuck with it, or should I check in with someone about it first?
they want some static text to be controlled by the cms
too many short term cooks in that design :)
as in changes that should be integrated?
hah
yeah, figures
I'll check in with phong
maybe I can check some of the clojure stuff out and bring it back to coherence
patchwork: I hva luxuria superbia running if you want to take a peek
yeah, opens up a lot of ideas for alternative game design

https://github.com/stuartsierra/component looking at integrating this library into caribou
as a general startup / configure / shutdown / reconfigure design to fit everything else in
HAH
I almost forgot
OK, if I try to use it, I will plan to fork it
but it is a good design
I am thinking that, plus avout for coordination, plus some solidified middleware conventions plus the still to be discovered clean way to register and find hooks in clojure for migrations = caribou.plugin
patchwork: we just need to sell him on a backward incompatible change to his attitude to backward incompatibility
after that he would be prevented by basic contradiction from ever embracing non-compatibility again
I discovered today that ring middleware can use mutliple args
if we ever decide to separate things out of the single-god-map model
I hadn't thought it was possible
if our own middlwares are compatible, we could have handlers be their own map
s/handlers/helpers
{d,f}uck {f,d}at
I hate fuck dat
it looks like stuartsierra's component library could encompass both config handling and migrations (we could extend our components so they also take an arg that returns their migrations - the funcionality of looping over all components regardless of namespace is already provided)
patchwork1: inkscape is the OSS tool for vector graphics
it even does a trace function to import from a photo (then you can go in and delete / adjust the breakpoints it autogenerates to make a cleaner vector)
also incscape files can be read and manipulated as data structures in clojure

"we run all our caribou deployments on immutant"
I have never used immutant, and had no idea we were using it in production
I had no idea
I have them outnumbered by 1 I think
I'll have to try it I guess
like I said, I have never tried it
I guess because the *nix ecosystem is something I am pretty comfortable with already, so I wasn't looking for tooling to help me deal with it?
but it isn't like I decided to never try it
I just never got around to it
I am brainstorming zero downtime upgrade for caribou
zookeeper (avout) will be the lynchpin that makes it work
once we have proper inter-instance coordination, we can do version upgrades to an app where at any moment at least one server is handling requests
with a short moment of indeterminacy where some requests are handled by version x of the app, and some by version y
hah
let me just run a quick git gc before you do that - anyone got a hammer or maybe a car battery?
quile: are you saying there is some java functionality that already does what I am thinking of?
heh
it's fucking magic - I set an atom in one vm, and the value is instantly seen in the other
yeah
simple simple
now to embed it into the guts of caribou
no more "restart your caribou because someone else added a page"
http://vlazzarini.github.io/ csound now runs in chrome via the magic of pnacl
the c code is compiled into chrome byte code, and runs in the browser, controlled by js
with a recent enough chrome, it just works, no visible downloads or anything
dude! kinda
with web sockets for collaboration :)
those unicode symobls are supposedly "face savoring delicious food" and "pot of food"
does model/init clear the query cache?
I'll look in the source, thanks
I guess I could also find out empiricially
it does call invoke-models
bind-models may do it in invoke-models
I will experiment (using the latest caribou template)
if m/init does not clear it, I will call query/clear-queries
which clearly does clear it all, looking at the source
first I will make avout work with the models map in config
second step is query-cache busting
should both be totally doable
hmm
with query-caching on, model/init is not sufficient to see new models
I think I need to manually bust the cache then run model/init
yeah, I can just clear it manually, if that is the design you indended
by calling caribou.query/clear-queries
since the db request model/init does is using the cached query from the last model/init
well I will make a pr for that :)
should init bust the cache, or should invoke-models do it?
will do
actually avout was going to be done as a standalone middleware
no changes to the rest of caribou
OK
with avout as a middleware it is then immediately usable by other non-caribou projects, and easy to use by caribou projects that do not use models, etc.
basically I have with-zoo, which takes a key name and a server an updater a function, and returns a function that behaves like the original, except it runs the updater if the key changes value
and the handler is with-zoo with the appropriate server and key args
but it is even usable outside a ring stack, you could wrap any function that should be coordinated in with-zoo
well, the db page changes should be visible when the cache is busted
or do you need to tell pages to reload? if so I can throw that in the updater
will emptying the pages make the reload happen, or do I need to regenerate them in this handler?
(if appropriate, of course)
I can test this empirically of course :)
ahh, so I can set :reset true in config
and it does the rest
err...
no
ahh, so I would call it if pages change
food cart indian today?
or robotaco
ahh, that looks right
thanks
wait, what about calling the reload-pages that is defined in the same core ns?
ok
if there were a comment or two in handler.clj I may have realized this sooner :)
making progress...
patchwork: annie? cool
I am going to have to figure out how to extrapolate from the structure of the query cache to a value to invalidate any matching cache in a peer
*the value to invalidate in any
filter those keys that have changed, and share those keys so any peers know to clear them in their query cache?
I want to do a more granular busting of the cache
so I am looking at which keys changed, to propagate that info
maybe I should just do an all or nothing cache bust though
that would be simpler
because I am capturing the values in a clojure
and testing equality
I can do full map equality, or by-key equality
sorry, in a closure
(let [queries (atom @(query/queries))] (fn bust? [] (if (not (= @queries @(query/queries))) ...)))
http://rorywalsh.github.io/RIBCsound/index.html <= webapp that creates a synth gui, and then exports gui plus csound code as a standalone page using pnacl
the webapp is open source
https://github.com/rorywalsh/RIBCsound
quile: being coherent as I is a fairly low barrier
regarding the earlier talk about integrating avout
since zookeeper is a big external dependency, what about keeping it optional by putting {:query {:storage-method f}} in the config map? and then you could set the method to use an atom, or an avout bound version of an atom, or whatever
patchwork: got a moment to hash out a zookeeper design issue?
I think I found a way to minimally alter core, and integrate the avout functionality
no prob, just let me know
quile: patchwork: I got a very reasonable suggestion about the wording on let-caribou.in what repo would I clone to make a pr for that content?
seems I don't have the perms
https://github.com/Instrument/caribou-marketing I see this but it does not seem to reflect the site
anyway, the request was just s/performant/efficient which I totally agree with
did you add me? thanks if so
? maybe it was that caribou team did not have access to let-caribou-in
I thought I was on the caribou team
anyway I made a "buzzword-reduction" branch, with one small pr against master for now
patchwork: nice
patchwork: all for replacing the whole deal
if we can come up with something better
AWESOME
it appears varargs does not work on protocol definitions
I will join the chorus
I guess I could manually define all arg counts from 0 to 10
hah
impale competitors on your mighty rack of antlers while building domain apropriate data models
hah
oh, the trick for defnining the state-coordinator protocol: the implementation for java.lang.Object is just the arg (for reset) or (f this) (for swap)
and just ignore the varargs versions of swap!
which is not so onerous
quile: indeed!
(extend-protocol gripe java.lang.Object ([this f] (f this)))
almost a pun on "object"
patchwork: were we actually using update-config? because it looks like as is it treats value as a function if the arg is not an atom, but as a value to replace the old one if it is an atom
which is weird
unless I misunderstand this code
it is defined
that is the only instance of its existance in all clojure projects I have checked out
never called
so, all this work for something unused!
but I will make it coherent
so maybe it will get used
and this protocol way of doing things is better than putting a bunch of functions in config anyway
dependency injection ftw
just ran lein check on caribou-core, I am going to look into some of those reflection warnings one of these days
woah, jvm 8 eliminates permgen
replacing it with "metaspace"
patchwork: you never told me you were designing java 8!
it seems so, I need to do more research on how so
anyway, you should know since you helped design it :)
http://java.dzone.com/articles/java-8-permgen-metaspace
it is marked as separate from heap, but draws on the same pool, and the same maximum usage quota
so if your heap size is big enough, it will expand
unlike permgen
fair enough
the space in which we store space
I just found out that http-kit is within 10% of nginx's performance
and tomcat is significanly slower than either http-kit or jetty
I say we ditch the tomcat and nginx elements on the next caribou deploy, and just use http-kit (running the project as java -jar) and varnish in front of it
TIL calling peek on a vector in clojure returns the last element in O(1) time
but calling last on the same vector returns the last element in O(n) time
!
weird
suddenly I realize why you would use peek
I used to think it was kind of pointless
MOTHERFUCKER
we keep things in model/models that are not serializable
so we cannot use a distributed store for them
glad we had that talk :)
I just fucking got it
models, query cache, and reverse-query-cache all in zookeeper
WOO

and I'd like to thank all my loyal fans
quile - fucking a, we are for real huh?
https://github.com/noisesmith/reins reins is live
rein in your reindeer
literally two lines of code in your boot.clj, and one in your project.clj, and you get coordinated caribou state
nb: requires my yet-to-be-merged caribou branch
the awesome thing is how fucking small that plugin is
I even took out the clojure / caribou deps on the project, to make it clear it is an extension you add to an existing caribou
depending on performance, I may update it to an incremental change model
rather than shared data as it is now
that would be faster, but more complex to implement
not too complex for me mind you, just complex enough to be a bad idea if we don't need it
what a nice way to spend my vacation morning, rescuing an ec2 production box that died
the ec2 instance fucked up
they told us it was due for replacement soon... about the same time the thing stopped serving requests
well a little after - when we got the message I checked the site and it seemed ok
but died shortly after
I did a bunch of futile shit to try and recreate the env, but rt got it snapshotted and got the snapshot running
*r2
patchwork: so regarding zookeeper / avout, I got it working but the load that using it for config would put on zookeeper may be a bit more than zookeeper is designed for
so if we want to use it in production we may have to go back to my initial "trigger changes" model
but for dev time sharing config via zookeeper should save a lot of hassle
small key value pairs
not huge maps of queries
the idea being it sends a signal, not provides your data
but like I said, during dev this should be fine
it is designed for low latency, rather than throughput
*rather than high throughput
patchwork: http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/trunk/zookeeperProgrammers.html#Data+Access
"Zookeeper was not designed to be a general database or large object store."
every write to a key is a full replacement of the entire key
so every update to any model means replacing the entire model map
unless we made each model a zk key
that would scale better
right, like my initial suggestion, if you remember :)
well, that is what zk provides, what we need is to hook into it
I think you can have a watch on an avout atom
yeah, add-watch works on avoud distributed atoms
so you add a watch to the atom, and do the db call appropriate for that atom
so put an increment in the atom, if we see the value go up, we do a model/init
and any client can swap!! inc to make the others reload
the watch triggers if you change it
or if someone else does
that is why a number helps
well my idea is each thing we watch would be its own distributed-atom
each one idempotent
so we would have one for restart, one for update-models, one for clear-cache(key), one for shutdown
to keep things simple
yeah
you could think of each one as a route
but not using ring of course
regardless, the pull request on caribou-core stands, and whatever I/we design for this can use the new protocol
so caribou core can treat it the same way
also, avout has a mongodb backend, so maybe we can use avout/mongo, store the shared config as a distributedatom that way, and call it good?
I will look into that
in other news, I am working on the caribou plugin protocol and coordination
and if my plans work out we can marshall all the hook and migration setup through caribou-plugin
rather than configuring each of these things by hand
well, as I mentioned I've been hammoking it for a while
and I had kind of a breakthrough as I was working on the avout integration
sure
at this point nrepl is a protocol, not just one app, btw
I answered a stack overflow question about using datomic with caribou(!)
one more thing about the nrepl/schmetterling thing: it requires no changes to nrepl, nrepl takes middlewares, and you could have a stack navigation / code sending / alerting middleware - it would be some work, but requires no change to nrepl
you would get a handle to a frame/context and what to display there
and provide it to have code evaluated
may be more trouble than it is worth, but it seems possible
it would provide a means that nrepl users could hook it into their UI
right
and no need for you to do that for them
all they are asking is we consider talking to that protocol
well, there is ritz, but nobody can make any sense of its design
it is trying to act like the common lisp debugger, by abstracting over jdt - poorly
I commented on the schmetterling thread (which you probably noticed)
patchwork: you still around?
so I was looking at some stuff yesterday, about clojure webservers
http-kit run via java-jar on your clojure uberjar should be within ~10% of nginx
in performance
so we could drop both tomcat and nginx from our standard deployment
and just have caribou/http-kit behnind varnish
*behind
two dependencies
yeah I noticed
for security reasons?
what could a client do by connecting directly to http-kit that they could not do with nginx in the middle?
oh interesting
OK
and that isn't something the varnish layer could do?
no, not much
just used it for this latest deploy
before that we used beanstalk
or SYL, where maybe someone else set up nginx
I am willing to accept nginx as manditory if must be
patchwork: nope, no tomcat on syl, it dates from the multiple jar days
right
yeah
that's fine, if we need nginx. Just wasn't aware.
I would like to replace the things tomcat did for us though
like log coordination
and hell turning printing to stdout into logging
tomcat did a few nice things - by my count I would want: a service definition in /etc/services such that we could run "service caribou [start|stop|restart]
and logrotate setup
and turning stdout into logs
that is mostly it
right
and that way your app does not need to be root
but varnish can help with some of that too
it has some overlapping functionality
just scheming on simplifying things, including the deployment stack
patchwork: I think it can, it has routing options and rewrite options
http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3334023/configure-multiple-sites-with-varnish
wait, that may not be exactly it
anyway, varnish is a full on DSL (varnish config language, vcl) that can do a lot of fancy shit
I used it to turn off cookie creation for the non-admin parts of the site when I discovered that I was not using the cookie session store properly and it was setting a caribou-admin cookie for all requests
true that, but slower than a bunch of the java alternatives(!)
based on benchmarks at least
probably because good threading is harder to do in c, so they end up being more conservative, so you get more bottlenecks
https://github.com/ptaoussanis/clojure-web-server-benchmarks
that is one set
see you tomorrow
yeah
notice http-kit well outperforming nginx
patchwork: when you get to more load (more threads) thus my theory
there is another one I don't see at the moment
that quile was fond of sharing
patchwork: rough sketch https://github.com/caribou/caribou-plugin/tree/master/src/caribou/plugin
my thought was hooks (if any) would be added in the migrate method
hmm, yeah, may be better to be more explicit
but hooks don't really have a functional interface the way handlers do
in usage you would have to ensure you replace your config / plugins with those returned, because the input is not modified, the whole lib is functional
ahh
so the same thing I do for helpers, I'll throw that in, why not
and that provides the end user the chance to wrap a hook before they get applied, if it pleases them to do so
easy
thanks, I put a lot of thought into it
yeah
by extending java.lang.Object you can just ignore the methods you don't supply, and get the noop version of the method
*since it extends...
we could cut down the line count in caribou core by doing something similar with the db adapters
good, me too :)
no, they don't
but I think we can make it happen
we could make a persistence protocol
the current db stuff would be the sql implementation of the persistence protocol
then a query protocol, similar deal
right
query.clj could just be made a specific implementation
then we pull out the stuff that is actually more general
but worthwile!
I love the idea of any given storage backend being an injected dependency
shrinking caribou as much as can be done, and letting the user extend it
so we could make a caribou-sql project, and a caribou-keystore
and any given user would only need one of those, plus an implementation that implements that protocol
If you think of a good way to divvy up the task I am willing to put some hours in. Though I fully understand if you want to have control over that change.
cool
also, while we are at it, it may be cool to do explicit separation of state from config, plus at least the option of passing in config / state as args rather than binding them as dynamic vars
the more I mess with stuff, the more wary I am of dynamic binding
fluokitten? I'll look into it
or data.lenses
https://github.com/cark/data.lenses lenses are really interesting
I redefined "state" in caribou.plugin.state to be totally persistent and stateless
I left the names unchanged for irony
being motivated by irony makes me feel like a batman villian
https://github.com/cark/data.lenses/blob/master/example/src/example/core.clj lenses runthrough
ouch
so maybe we don't need lenses, just the ephemeral lost monad lib it uses
is it on sonatype or something? or they just point to a silly version
patchwork: caribou meeting today?
we've pretty much been doing that over IRC already anyway
this whole conversation could have been on #antler

patchwork: http://www.emacswiki.org/MiniMap yay we can have minimap like those silly sublime-text users
you can use it like a scrollbar
grab it and scroll it
heh
it is like a scroll bar but more informative
in general
the shape of some part of your code is often distinctive
we could ask for tertiary displays
just for our minimaps
I want a tetrahedron of displays surrounding me
one of them with a hinge so I can crawl out
you do
it is just a very large bubble
like world-like in size
you could call it a planet even
heh
‽‽‽‽‽‽ HAWII
patchwork: also, the minimap had top level definitions in a much larger font, so it acts as a TOC showing you where to scroll to get to that definition
which is maybe the best part

https://soundcloud.com/information/dec3 patchwork quile made this this morning, not a noise piece
viola quartet
I did a bit of copy and paste rather than memorizing
so it is pseudo-improvised
I should port that clojure svg lib I found to cljs, it is nice
thanks
I'll be needing a better viola soon
and some skill
and more time practicing
I intentionally repeated the uncertain bowings as a framing device
but yes, I also do that
almost every repeated phrase (literally copy and paste in the editor) had and uncertain or flawed attack to it
heh
it could be known as an opening or pause
the wisdom of recording a moment of uncertainty for posterity, on the other hand
is lunch
(migration/run-migration migration)
yay for naming
as predicted re that github issue
everything going as planned
quile: vim trivia - does vim have a concept of a buffer with no file associated?
cool
and you can edit that buffer I assume
technomancy is plotting some extension to nrepl protocol with content types and magic, so that question came up
it can already send html to a client, which is what he suggests if we were to integrate schmetterling/nrepl
patchwork: I don't think I like this interface for migrating from the plugin, and I wonder if we can add a layer decomplecting migrations from namespaces
I am thinking plugin maybe shouldn't provide a namespace, but a unique key
right now the only way to do a proper migration is to pass in a string for a namespace
I vote we keep that layer
but abstract the code finding from the logging/checking/applying
so that I could provide a key, if that key is in the migrations my migration is not run, if it isn't, my migration is run and the key added to the db
just checking in before I start hacking away at that
OK, letting it sink in, it is a small fix that will be backward compatible, I will issue a PR as usual
I am officially fully ingrained and addicted to paredit mode now
design question: one migration per plugin, or allow them to return N migrations that we iterate on?
right now I am leaning toward having them return a [[migration rollback]*] sequence
to pseudo-regexp it
right
sounds good
it occurs to me that we will want to make migration a model, rather than a table
I think we can bootstrap
either that or only sql users get to have migrations
seriously
did I mention my org -> edn converter pipe dream? still scheming it
well edn -> org first
as a way to get structured inspection with collapsing branches
hs-mode will collapse sexps
but I like the org mode UI better
really I would use it for data structures in general, less for the specific code case
would it be too much magic to also update the pages/handlers in the config when the plugins get initialized? for now they are returned and it is assumed the user will take that step
could make a config key for it
lol
regarding the migration bootstrap, what if each storage adapter defined its own "reify-migrations" migration, that turned the migrations table into a model with fields?
planning ahead
and interacting with things that will need changed
OK
this comes up because I am needing to modify migrations in order to use them from plugins, which gives me insight into how they will need to adapt to other storage
big plans
not to worry, just doing plugins now, everything compatible with existing usages of caribou
making it work with teague, by putting features in teague into plugins
D O G
patchwork: can one define a caribou page with a function that acts as controller, without needing to bind the function in a controller-ns?
if not, I want to make it possible
ahh
is there a branch with polaris integrated?
or is this something I would need to do?
I guess I can test my plugin shit with the "alter-var-root on a var in the controller ns" method, if it comes to that.
and in the meantime
I am glad we are making these things more general
smoothing all these little bumps once and for all
until caribou is a mirror reflecting pure inspiration
lunchdog
patchwork: check it out, you can open a string in a new buffer, and when you save it replaces the string contents https://github.com/magnars/string-edit.el
it handles escaping and shit
I'm down for lunch
so string-edit-at-point is awesome
in the string-edit package, I linked it above
open the string in a tiny buffer
when you are done editing, it escapes the string
so you can edit the string in an unescaped format
also it works recursively
if you need multi levels of escape
(print "\"\\\"hello\\\"\"\n")
double escape
patchwork: http://sprunge.us/Ygba
a function I have been wanting for a while in emacs, I finally just wrote it
elisp is kind of annoying actually, now that I am used to clojure
I mean delq nil mapcar instead of remove nil?
pretty much
someone wrote a graphic towers of hanoi puzzle solver in posix complient vi
this is a feature we need by the way
bulk asset creation would be nice
or do you mean a different guy
do we have a simple function for creating an asset for a file by path? if so we could show him a small file that defines a migration to create his image+xml two asset model, and then a loop to create one for each pair it finds
or tell him he can do that and show him where our functions are
(the migration definition and asset import)
we do have one function that will import an asset from a file, right?
awesome, great to hear
in caribou.asset?
oh, the :source key
still working on that one turing-oracle we need
clojure has the "bean" function so we can turn anything into a reified bean - or is that refried beans/

and it blew up in your face and you hate me forever
oh, what failed?
it only works with a macro if you know the class string at read time
that is true of macros in general
ahh right
I think we can adapt that
(name symbol) for one
ok

heh, why not both?

this morning in my SPARE TIME I finished up the alpha for plugins
let me make sure the latest is pushed
https://github.com/Instrument/teague/tree/plugins/src/caribou/plugin examples of what plugins look like now
pulling them in: https://github.com/Instrument/teague/blob/plugins/src/teague/boot.clj
using them in the handler: https://github.com/Instrument/teague/blob/plugins/src/teague/core.clj
less than perfect, but looking good I think, and all features are tested
I had one more thought: if we want to call boot and init plugins for migrate, then we should have a separate "run" method for plugins (that is called in core) for the repl plugin for example
patchwork: the args are arbitrary
they are in the definition of the individual plugin
they read the config
ahh, yeah
yeah, right now create is not in the protocol, it is a wrapper around extend
right
those things are in the way an individual plugin is defined, rather than the plugin spec
true
let's not architect it though :)
I mean someone will want to make a function that outputs plugins, and it may not work with map args
or some whatever
you know
that as-keymap macro I showed earlier was so I could avoid doing {:reload-pages reload-pages :provide-connect-data provide-connect-data ...} when initializing the handler list
there is a reason it is just in the one handler definition (which is still teague specific) and not in the plugins namespace :)
working on it
so, as I was saying the run method
since we want to load all of the plugins for the migrate task
but don't want the repl-plugin to actually start a repl
or the ring plugin to start a webserver (if we took it that far)
but there is a clear path forward with that, just a question of doing it :)

"My new thesaurus is terrible. It's also terrible."
yup!
because foo is the head
clojure is actually very clumsy about optimizing compared to eg. haskell
for example (nth (map #(Math/pow % 12) (range)) 2000) should totally be optimizable into one op
but clojure will evaluate all 2000 operations
in that case, it is because haskell is strict about side effects that haskell can just jump to the right index, but clojure cannot guarantee that there are not side effects you want
this one will not change in 1.6
yours might
since that is just an advanced example of locals clearing
I meant "not knowing what is impure / pure" by "this"
your example has some hope of being optimized, since it matches the vision clojure devs have about what you can expect from clojure, my example is considered a "not gonna go there" thing (they said this directly to me in IRC)

well, the usr/lib/jvm part is the variable

http://gigaom.com/2014/01/14/breaking-court-strikes-down-fccs-net-neutrality-rules/
"An appeals court in Washington on Tuesday ruled that the FCC’s “net neutrality” rules, which prevent companies like Verizon from favoring some types of internet traffic over others, are invalid."

"Such “perfect” freedom is, of course, an incoherent idea, and if Harris is arguing against it, he is not finding a “deep” problem with compatibilism but a shallow problem with his incompatibilist vision of free will; he has taken on a straw man, and the straw man is beating him."

"The Chinese knew about the tempered scale even before it was invented in the West, but they chose not to use it. They seem to have decided to put the differences to good use. If the equivalent of "do mi mi, mi so so" sounds different in the equivalent of their key of C and their key of E, then that is a useful thing because the feeling that goes along with those sounds is different."

every time I look at one of the more math heavy chapters (like the one on symbolic music), I get a little more of what it means
patchwork: check out page 159 in the above
he describes a set of lemmas and rules to create a vector-space of notes
"Sets H (melodic intervals), G (intensity intervals), U (time intervals), and T (intervals of time separating the sonic events, and independent of them) are totally ordered. We also assume that they may be isomorphic under certain conditions with set R of the real numbers, and that an external law of composition for each of them may be established with set R."

a bunch of proposals he makes in there are still not fully realized
